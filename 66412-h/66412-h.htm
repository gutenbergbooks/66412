PREFACE.
</p>

<p>
In the following pages, and in delineating
the character of my hero, I have chosen
the ranks of the 2nd Dragoons, not
because of any national partiality, but
from the desire to describe the adventures
of a soldier in a brave old regiment,
which has served with distinction in
every war since its formation&mdash;in short,
from the battles of the Covenant to those
in the Crimea; which had the proud
distinction of capturing the Colours of the
Regiment du Roi at Ramillies, the White
Standard of King Louis' Household Troops
at Dettingen, and the Colour and Eagle of
Napoleon's 45th Foot at Waterloo.
</p>

<p>
Several historical incidents, and one or
two traditions of the Service are
interwoven with the story of Basil Gauntlet,
the Scots Grey.
</p>

<p>
I may mention that the misfortunes of
his comrade Charters are nearly similar
to those which befel an officer of the
15th Hussars prior to the war in the
Peninsula; and that the dark story and
death of the engineer Monjoy and of
Madame d'Escombas formed one of the
<i>causes célèbres</i> before the Parliament of
Paris during the middle of the last
century.

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
BY THE WAYSIDE.
</h3>

<p>
My adventures were my sole inheritance
long before I thought of committing them
to paper for the amusement of myself,
and&mdash;may I hope&mdash;for the instruction of
others.
</p>

<p>
Wayward has been my fate&mdash;my story
strange; for my path in life&mdash;one portion
of it at least&mdash;has been among perils and
pitfalls, and full of sorrow and mortification,
but not, however, without occasional
gleams of sunshine and triumph.
</p>

<p>
On an evening in the month of
February&mdash;no matter in what year, suffice
it to say that it was long, long ago&mdash;I
found myself near a little town on the
Borders between England and Scotland,
with a shilling in my hand, and
this small coin I surveyed with certain
emotions of solicitude, because it was
my <i>last one</i>.
</p>

<p>
I sat by the wayside under an old
thorn-tree whereon the barons of
Netherwood had hung many a Border outlaw
and English mosstrooper in the olden
time; and there I strove to consider what
I should do next; but my mind seemed a
very chaos.
</p>

<p>
In this unenviable condition I found,
myself on the birthday of my eighteenth
year&mdash;I, the heir to an old title and to a
splendid fortune&mdash;homeless, and well-nigh
penniless, without having committed a
crime or an error of which conscience
could accuse me.
</p>

<p>
The rolling clouds were gathering in
grey masses on the darkening summits of
the Cheviot hills in the hollows of which
the snows of the past winter lay yet
unmelted.  The cold wind moaned in the
leafless woods, and rustled the withered
leaves that the autumn gales had strewn
along the highway.  The dull February
evening crept on, and the road that wound
over the uplands was deserted, for the
last wayfarer had gone to his home.  The
sheep were in their pen and the cattle in
their fold; no sound&mdash;not even the bark
of a dog&mdash;came from the brown sides of
the silent hills, and, affected by the gloomy
aspect of Nature, my heart grew heavy,
after its sterner and fiercer emotions passed
away.
</p>

<p>
The last flush of sunset was fading in
the west; but I could see about three
miles distant the gilt vanes and round
turrets of Netherwood Hall shining above
the strove of leafless trees that surrounded
it, and I turned away with a sigh of
bitterness, for adversity had not yet
taught me philosophy.  I was too young.
</p>

<p>
With the express intention of visiting
Netherwood Hall, I had travelled several
miles on foot; but now, when in sight of
the place, my spirit failed and my heart
sickened within me; and thus, irresolute
and weary, I seated myself by the side
of the way, and strove to arrange my
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
To be brief, I shall describe in a few
pages, who and what I am, and how on
that sombre February evening I came to
be on such unfortunate terms with old
Dame Fortune.
</p>

<p>
My grandfather, Sir Basil Gauntlet, of
Netherwood, had so greatly resented
his eldest son's marriage with a lady who
had no fortune save her beauty, that he
withdrew all countenance and protection
from him.  So far did he carry this
unnatural enmity, that by will he bequeathed
all his property to the son of a brother,
and, with great barbarity, permitted my
father to be consigned to the King's
Bench prison, by which his commission
in the cavalry was forfeited; and there,
though a brave and high-spirited officer,
who had served under the Marquis of
Granby, he died of despair!
</p>

<p>
My mother soon followed him to the
land that lies beyond the grave; and thus
in infancy I was left, as the phrase is, to
the <i>tender</i> mercies of the world in general,
and my old bruin of a grandfather in particular.
</p>

<p>
Yet this upright Sir Basil, who was so
indignant at his son's penniless marriage,
had been in youth one of the wildest
rakes of his time.  He had squandered
vast sums on the lovely Lavinia Fenton&mdash;the
original Polly Peachum&mdash;and other
fair dames, her contemporaries; indeed,
it was current in every green-room in
London, that he would have run off with
this beautiful actress, had he not been
anticipated, as all the world knows, or
ought to know, by his grace the Duke of
Bolton, who made her his wife.
</p>

<p>
Sir Basil had been wont to drink his
three bottles daily, as he said, "without
a hair of his coat being turned."  He had
paraded three of his best friends, on three
different occasions, for over-night insults
of which he had a very vague recollection
in the morning; but then "after what
had occurred," what else could he do? and
so after bathing his head and right
arm in vinegar to make his aim steady,
he winged them all at Wimbledon
Common, or the back of Montagu House.
</p>

<p>
In London he was the terror of the
watch, and would smash all the lamps in
Pall Mall or elsewhere, when, after losing
perhaps a thousand guineas at White's
among blacklegs and bullies, or after
carrying the sedan of some berouged fair
one through the streets with links flaring
before it, he came reeling home, probably
with a broken sword in one hand, a bottle
in the other, and his pockets stuffed with
brass knockers and other men's wigs;
consequently Sir Basil should have
remembered the days of his youth, and
have tempered the acts of his old age
with mercy; but it was otherwise.
</p>

<p>
I do not mean to detain the reader by
a long history of my earlier years; for if
those of a Cæsar or an Alexander have
but little in them to excite interest, still
less must the boyhood of one who began
the world as a simple dragoon in the
king's service.
</p>

<p>
The good minister of Netherwood, and
the English rector on the south side of
the Border, frequently besought Sir Basil
to be merciful to the orphan child of his
eldest son.
</p>

<p>
"I pray you to recollect, Sir Basil,"
urged the rosy-faced rector, "that your
own marriage was a love-match."
</p>

<p>
"It must have been so, if all you
scandalous fellows at Oxford said truth."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"For there you said I loved the whole
female sex."
</p>

<p>
The jolly rector laughed so much at
the poor jest of the old rake, that the
latter actually became commiserate; or it
may be that my mother's death and my
utter desolation, stirred some emotion of
shame&mdash;pity he had none&mdash;in Sir Basil's
arid heart; so, to keep me at a distance
from himself, he consigned me on a
pittance to the care of his country agent,
a certain Mr. Nathan Wylie, who was
exceedingly well-named, as he was a
canting Scotch lawyer&mdash;in truth "a
cunning wretch whose shrivelled heart was
dead to every human feeling," and who by
the sharpness of his legal practice was a
greater terror on both sides of the Border
than ever the mosstroopers were of old.
</p>

<p>
He was the person who had prepared
and executed the will which transferred
my heritage to my cousin, Tony Gauntlet&mdash;a
will which he framed with peculiar
satisfaction, as he hated my father for
making free with his orchard in boyhood,
and in later years for laying a horsewhip
across his shoulders at the market-cross
of Greenlaw, so in his sanctified dwelling
I was likely to have a fine time of it!
</p>

<p>
For ten years I resided with the godly
Nathan Wylie, a repining drudge, ill-fed,
ill-clad, and poorly lodged, in one of those
attics which he apportioned to Abraham
Clod, his groom, his pigeons and myself&mdash;uncared
for by all; and not unfrequently
taunted with the misfortunes of my
parents for whom I sorrowed, and the
neglect of my grandfather whom I had
learned to abhor and regard with boyish
terror.
</p>

<p>
I picked up a little knowledge of law&mdash;at
least such knowledge as one might
learn in the office of a Scotch country agent
in those days.  I mastered, I believe,
even "Dirlton's Doubts," and other equally
amusing literature then in vogue; while
Nathan Wylie took especial care that I
should know all the shorter catechism,
and other biblical questions by rote, that
I might be able to repeat them when the
minister paid us his periodical visit, though
my elbows were threadbare, my shoes none
of the best, and my eyes and brain ached
with drudging at the desk far into the
hours of the silent night, penning prosy
documents, preparing endless processes,
and not unfrequently writing to
dictation such an epistle as the following,
which I give <i>verbatim</i> as it actually
appeared in a Border paper:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"DEAR SIR,&mdash;I am directed to raise an
action against you to-morrow for the sum
of one penny, together with the
additional sum of three shillings and
fourpence, sterling, the expense of this notice,
if both sums be not paid me before 9 a.m.
</p>

<p>
  "Yours, faithfully in the Lord,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"NATHAN WYLIE.<br />
</p>

<p>
"To Farmer Flail, &amp;c."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In early life he had married an old
and equally devout female client for the
money which he knew well she possessed;
and as that was all he wanted, after her
death he never married again, but devoted
himself manfully to the practice of the
law and extempore prayer&mdash;an external
air of great sanctity being rather
conducive to success in life in too many
parts of Scotland.
</p>

<p>
Poor Nathan has long been laid six
feet under the ground; but in fancy I
can still see before me his thin figure,
with rusty black suit and spotless white
cravat; his sharp visage, with keen, restless,
and cat-like eyes, that peered through
a pair of horn spectacles, and with shaggy
brows that met above them.  Moreover,
he had hollow temples, coarse ears, and a
tiger-like jaw, which he always scratched
vigorously when a case perplexed him, or
with satisfaction when some hapless client
was floored in the field of legal strife.
</p>

<p>
As years stole on, that keen and honest
sense of justice, which a boy seldom fails
to feel, inspired me with indignation at
the neglect with which my family treated
me, and the story of my parents and their
fate redoubled my hatred to my oppressors.
</p>

<p>
My cousin Tony, a harebrained fool,
whose mad fox-hunting adventures formed
the theme of all the Border side, and who,
by my grandfather's lavish and misplaced
generosity, was enabled to pursue a career
of prodigality and extravagance, came in
for a full share of my animosity, for he
was wont to ride past me on the highway
without the slightest recognition, save
once, when, flushed with wine, he was
returning from a hunting-dinner.
</p>

<p>
On that occasion he was ungenerous
enough to draw the attention of his groom
and whipper-in to the somewhat dilapidated
state of my attire, as I was trudging
along the highway on some legal message
to Farmer Flail at the Woodland Grange.
</p>

<p>
On hearing their derisive laughter, my
heart swelled with suppressed passion,
and had a weapon been in my hand, I
had struck them all from their saddles.
</p>

<p>
This crushing existence was not the
glorious destiny my boyish ambition had
pictured; but what could I do for a time,
save submit?  I had none to guide me&mdash;nor
father, nor mother, nor kindred were
there; and as a child, I often gazed
wistfully at other children who <i>had</i> all these,
and marvelled in my lonely heart what
manner of love they had for one another.
</p>

<p>
I was conscious of possessing a fund of
affection, of kindness and goodwill in my
own bosom; but there it remained pent
up for lack of an object whereon to lavish
it, or rather it was thrust back upon me by
the repulsive people by whom I was surrounded.
</p>

<p>
Business over, I would rush away to
solitude.  Sunk in reveries, vague and
deep, I would stroll for hours alone in the
starlight along the green and shady lanes,
or by the silent shore, where the German
sea rolled its creamy waves in ceaseless
and monotonous succession on the shingles,
or from whence it rippled in the splendour
of the moonlight far away&mdash;reveries filled
less with vain regrets than with visions
of a brilliant future, for my heart was
young, inspired by hope and thoughts
that soared above my present condition,
and sought a brighter destiny!
</p>

<p>
I could remember a time&mdash;alas! it
seemed a dream to me now&mdash;when I used
to repose in a pretty little bed, and when
a lady, who must have been my mother,
pale and thin and gentle-eyed, and
richly-attired too, for her satin dress
rustled, and her presence had a sense of
perfume, was wont to draw back the
curtains of silk and white lace to caress
and to kiss me.  Once a tear fell on my
cheek&mdash;it was hot&mdash;and she brushed it
aside with a tress of her gathered hair.
</p>

<p>
Was all this a reality, or a dream?  I
strove to conjure up when and where I
had seen this; but the memory of it was
wavering, and so indistinct, that at times
the treasured episode seemed to fade away
altogether.
</p>

<p>
In the long nights of winter I saved
up my candles&mdash;no easy task in the house
of a miser like Nathan Wylie&mdash;and,
retreating to my attic, read far into the
hours of morning; poring over such novels
and romances as were lent me by the
village milliner, a somewhat romantic old
maiden, who had been jilted by a recruiting
officer, and for whose memory she
always shed a scanty tear, for he fell at
the bombardment of Carthagena.  These
books I read by stealth, such literature
being deemed trash and dangerous
profanity in the godly mansion of Nathan
Wylie.
</p>

<p>
Then when the wind, that tore down
the rocky ravines of the Cheviots, howled
in the chimneys, or shook the rafters
above me, I loved to fancy myself at sea,
for the life of a sailor seemed to embody
all my ideas of perfect freedom&mdash;a bold
buccaneer, like Sir Henry Morgan&mdash;a
voyager, like Drake or Dampier&mdash;a
conqueror, like Hawke or Boscawen&mdash;a
wanderer, like dear old Robinson Crusoe, or
worthy Philip Quarll; and then I went to
sleep and to dream of foreign lands, of
lovely isles full of strange trees and
wondrous flowers, where scaly serpents crawled,
and spotted tigers lurked; of cities that
were all bannered towers, gilded cupolas
and marble temples, glittering in the
sunshine far beyond the sea.
</p>

<p>
A lonely child, I ripened into a lonely
lad, and so passed my life, until the
coming of Ruth Wylie, an event which
fully deserves a chapter to itself.

CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
RUTH WYLIE.
</h3>

<p>
Love occasioned my first scrape in life,
and thus it came to pass.
</p>

<p>
About the period of my aimless existence,
detailed in the last chapter, the
mansion of Mr. Nathan Wylie received a
new, and to him, in no way welcome
inmate, in the person of an orphan niece
from London, the daughter of a brother
who had died in circumstances the reverse
of affluent, bequeathing this daughter&mdash;then
in her sixteenth year&mdash;to his care.
</p>

<p>
This brother's letter&mdash;one penned on
his death-bed in an agony of anxiety for
the <i>future</i> of his orphan Ruth&mdash;was deeply
touching in its simple tenor; and some of
the references therein to years that had
long passed away, and to the pleasant
days of their boyhood, should have been
more than enough to soften even the
heart of Nathan Wylie; but he read it
unmoved, with a grimace on his thin
mouth and his beetle brows knit.
</p>

<p>
Then he carefully folded and docketed
it among others, with a gleam of irritation
in his cat-like eyes; and equally unmoved
by sympathy or compassion did he receive
his charge, when she arrived by the
stagecoach from London, pale with sorrow,
weary with travel, and clad in cheap and
simple mourning for the father she had
lost.
</p>

<p>
One generally imagines a Ruth to be
solemn, demure, and quiet&mdash;something
between a little nun and a Quakeress; but
Ruth Wylie sorely belied her name, being
a merry, kind, and affectionate girl, with
bewitching dark eyes, full of fun and
waggery, especially when uncle Nathan
was absent, for she failed to conceal that
his hard, short, and dry manner, and his
cold, immoveable visage chilled and
saddened her.
</p>

<p>
New and strange thoughts came into
my mind now; and soon I conceived a
regard for Ruth, notwithstanding her
hideous relation, the lawyer; for to me
old Nathan was a bugbear&mdash;an ogre!
</p>

<p>
Despite his angry and reiterated
injunctions, she frequently brought her
workbasket or book into the room where
we plodded with our pens, day after day, for
she loved companionship, and Nathan's
churlish old housekeeper bored her.
</p>

<p>
Then sometimes, when we would be
writing, and she was sewing or reading
near us, I might pause, for irresistible
was the temptation to turn to the soft and
downcast face of Ruth; and it was strange
that however deeply interested in her
book&mdash;however anxious about her
needlework, by some hidden or magnetic
influence, she, at the same time paused, and
raised her eyelids with a bright
inquiring smile, that never failed to thrill
my heart with joy, to make my hand
tremble, and every pulse to quicken, as
our glances instantly met and were
instantly withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
"Here is a little bit of romance at
last!" thought I; "already our thoughts
and aspirations draw towards each
other."
</p>

<p>
So I resolved to fall in love&mdash;most
desperately in love with Ruth Wylie&mdash;and
did so accordingly.
</p>

<p>
In the full bloom of girlhood, she was
at an age when all girls are pretty, or may
pass for being so; but Ruth was indeed
charming!
</p>

<p>
She had very luxuriant hair of a colour
between brown and bright auburn; its
tresses were wavy rather than curly, and
her complexion was of the dazzling purity
which generally accompanies hair of that
description, while her eyes were dark, and
their lashes black as night.
</p>

<p>
Our residence in the same house brought
us constantly together, and my love
ripened with frightful rapidity.  In three
days my case was desperate, and Ruth
alone could cure it.  I was sleepless by
night&mdash;feverish and restless by day; yet
I dared scarcely to address Ruth, for love
fills the heart of a boy with timidity.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it endues a girl with
courage, and so Ruth talked to me gaily,
laughed and rallied me, while my tongue
faltered, my cheek flushed or grew pale,
and my heart ached with love and new-born joy.
</p>

<p>
There is a strange happiness in the
first love of a boy and girl&mdash;the magnetic
sympathy which draws heart to heart, and
lip to lip, in perfect innocence, and without
a thought of the future, or of the solemn
obligations of life, and of the world&mdash;the
weary world, which, with all its
conventionalities, is more a clog to us than we
to it.
</p>

<p>
However, I soon perceived that Ruth
changed colour, too, when we met; and
my heart leaped joyously, when playfully
she kissed her hand to me at parting.  I
felt that I loved her dearly and deeply,
but how was I to tell her so?
</p>

<p>
In all the romances lent to me by my
friend, the milliner, the tall and handsome
heroes, cast their plumed beavers and
ample mantles on the ground, and flung
themselves on their knees before their
mistresses, beseeching them, in piercing
accents, to make them the happiest of
men, by giving them even the tips of
their snowy fingers to kiss; but I lacked
the courage to imitate these striking
proceedings; moreover, I possessed neither
velvet mantle nor ostrich plume.
</p>

<p>
One evening, old Nathan was absent on
business, and Ruth and I were seated in
the recess of a window, looking at a
collection of Hogarth's prints.  We sat close,
very close together, for the window was
narrow, and then the volume was so large
that we both required to hold it.  I felt
Ruth's breath at times upon my cheek,
and our hands touched every time we
turned a leaf.
</p>

<p>
Her pretty bosom, that heaved beneath
her bodice, which was cut square at the
neck, and somewhat low in front; her
snow-white arms, that came tapering forth
from the loose falling sleeves of her black
dress, and her delicate little hands so
bewildered me, that I never saw the prints
with which we were supposed to be
engrossed.  I saw Ruth&mdash;Ruth only, and
felt all the joy her presence inspired.
</p>

<p>
I knew that we both spoke at random,
and were somewhat confused in our questions
and answers; still more confused in
our long pauses.  I would have given the
world to have clasped this plump little
Ruth to my breast; yet I dared scarcely
to touch her hand.
</p>

<p>
As we stooped over the print of "Love
à la Mode," her bent head, her white
temple, and rich soft hair touched mine,
and she did not withdraw.
</p>

<p>
For a few seconds we sat thus, head
reclined against head; then I panted
rather than breathed, as my arm stole
round her waist, and my trembling lips
were pressed upon her pure forehead.
</p>

<p>
Mr. William Hogarth was permitted to
fall ignominiously on the carpet; and we
sat thus entwined in each other's arms for
a long time&mdash;I know not how long&mdash;till
the twilight deepened round us, and we
were roused from our dream of happiness
by a harsh and croaking voice, which exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Fool that I am, not to have foreseen
this!"
</p>

<p>
We started and found ourselves
confronted by Mr. Nathan Wylie, whose
grey eyes glared in the dusk like those of
a polecat, through the rims of his horn
spectacles.
</p>

<p>
Poor Ruth uttered a cry and fled; but
I turned boldly and faced the enemy.
</p>

<p>
"So, sir," he exclaimed, in a voice that
trembled with silly rage; "so, sir, this is
the way you conduct yourself in the house
of a God-fearing man, who has saved you
from destruction, when your whole family
abandoned you!  Is this your gratitude,
Master Philander&mdash;this the result of those
pious lessons which I have sought to
instil into you?  But hark you, sirrah, so
sure as I stand here&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Wylie," I began, with all the
coolness I could assume; "I beg that
you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Peace, you young villain, and don't
attempt to bully me!" he thundered
out; but, immediately adopting his usual
whining tone, he added: "Peace I say, for
I stand here as a rampart between you and
destruction&mdash;as a watchman unto Israel.
But what virtue or honour, piety or
morality am I likely to find in one who
bears the name of Basil Gauntlet?  After
what I have seen to-night, Ruth shall
remain a prisoner in her own room, and I
must consult with your grandfather about
having you sent off to sea, or away from
here on any terms."
</p>

<p>
This would have been welcome intelligence
some time ago; but the presence
of Ruth had altered the aspect of
everything, and I retired to my attic, less to
ponder over the rough manner in which
we had been wakened from our dream of
joy, than to repeat, react and dream it
over and over again, with the sweet
conviction that Ruth permitted me to love
her, and loved me in return.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
THE SEQUEL.
</h3>

<p>
Nathan Wylie was as wicked as his word;
and a letter, rehearsing in forcible terms
my sinful, ungracious, and godless conduct,
was duly despatched to my grandfather, at
Netherwood Hall.
</p>

<p>
Pending a reply thereto, Ruth was
confined to her own room, and kept securely
under lock and key, while I was all but
chained to my desk, for Nathan Wylie
had an old dread of the enterprising
nature of the Gauntlets, and knew not what
I might do next.
</p>

<p>
In our mutual loneliness of position,
our hearts naturally drew together, and
our love was strengthened by the very
barriers her uncle raised between us;
hence I resolved to see Ruth in her own
room&mdash;her prison it seemed to me; but
this could only be done by the window,
and under cloud of night, as her door was
locked, and the key was in old Wylie's
pocket.
</p>

<p>
On coming to this resolution, I proceeded
at once to put it in practice.  Heaven
knows, I had no desire but to circumvent
old Wylie, and to see my pretty Ruth&mdash;to
hear her gentle voice, and to be with
her, for her smile was the first ray of light
that had fallen across my hitherto dark
and solitary path.
</p>

<p>
It was on a gloomy night, early in
February, and when the little household
were supposed to be all in bed, that by
slipping from the window of my attic, I
reached the roof of the stable, the ridge
of which I knew to be immediately under
the window-sill of Ruth's apartment.
</p>

<p>
My heart beat lightly, happily, and
rapidly, when I saw the shadow of Ruth's
figure thrown in a somewhat colossal
outline, however, upon the curtains; and,
fortunately, without disturbing Abraham
Clod, the groom, I reached the window,
before Ruth had either retired to rest or
extinguished her light.
</p>

<p>
I know that this clandestine visit was
rather a wrong proceeding; but in
extenuation I have only to plead the
rashness of youth on one hand, and Nathan
Wylie's severity on the other; besides, at
eighteen one does not value the opinion
of the world much, or scan such matters
too closely.
</p>

<p>
On peeping in I saw Ruth pinning up
her bright brown hair, and beginning to
unfasten the hooks of her bodice; then
her dimpled elbows and tapered arms
shone white as alabaster in the light of
her candle; so I hastened to tap on the
window.
</p>

<p>
"Good Heaven!" she exclaimed, starting
round with alarm expressed in her
pretty face, and her dark eyes dilated;
"what is that&mdash;who is there?"
</p>

<p>
"I, I&mdash;don't you know me?" said I,
with my nose flattened against a pane of
glass.
</p>

<p>
"Basil&mdash;is it Basil?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"At my window, and at this time of
night!" said she, blushing and hastening
forward to open the sash; "wait until I
get a shawl&mdash;I was just about to undress.
How very odd; but what do you want?"
</p>

<p>
"To see you&mdash;to speak with you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But, Basil, consider&mdash;&mdash;" said she,
trembling.
</p>

<p>
"I consider nothing," I exclaimed,
throwing my arms round her, and kissing
her at the window.
</p>

<p>
"Mercy! take care lest you fall."
</p>

<p>
"This separation renders me miserable;
for two whole days I have not seen you."
</p>

<p>
Her kiss, so tender and loving, agitated
me so deeply that my voice was almost
inarticulate.
</p>

<p>
"And mewed up here, I have been so
wretched too, dear Basil," she murmured,
while placing her arms caressingly round
my neck, as I crept in and closed the
window; "how cruel of uncle Nathan to
treat us so."
</p>

<p>
"He has written to my grandfather,
and in such harsh terms that more
mischief will be in store for me," said I,
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Take courage, dear Basil," whispered
Ruth, as we sat with our arms entwined
and cheek pressed against flushing cheek;
"those wicked people would seem to have
done you already all the harm that is
possible."
</p>

<p>
"I know not; for your uncle spoke of
having me sent to sea; and I have heard
at times of people being kidnapped by the
pressgang."
</p>

<p>
"The pressgang&mdash;you!" exclaimed
Ruth, her fine eyes filling with pity and
indignation; "they dare not think of such
a thing.  Are you not the heir to a
baronetcy?"
</p>

<p>
"True&mdash;one of our oldest Nova Scotian
baronetcies; but so is my cousin Tony,
if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"I were sent out of the way or disposed
of for ever."
</p>

<p>
"Of that title, dearest Basil; neither your
grandfather's wicked hatred, nor the
cunning of my uncle&mdash;alas! that I should
have to say so of one so near&mdash;can deprive
you."
</p>

<p>
"Between them, however, they have
willed away the estates to my cousin Tony
Gauntlet, who bids fair to make ducks and
drakes of them, even before his succession
comes to pass, for he is deeply involved
with jockeys and Jew money-lenders.  But
I care not what happens, if I am not
separated, my sweet little love, from you."
</p>

<p>
I pressed her to my breast long and
passionately.
</p>

<p>
For several nights I visited Ruth's
window in this clandestine manner; and
became so expert in the matter, that I
actually rubbed the sash of my casement
with soap, that it might run smoothly and
noiselessly.  As yet there came no reply
from Sir Basil, but Abraham Clod brought
a message from Netherwood, that "he had
the gout in both feet, and consequently
was unable to write."
</p>

<p>
Dear to us, indeed, were those stolen
interviews, and wild and vague were the
plans we began to form for the future, plans
chiefly drawn from our romances; but one
night we were roused from our happiness
by an unlooked for catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
Just as I was approaching Ruth's
window, a voice exclaimed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"A thief&mdash;a thief!  I see un&mdash;dang thee,
tak that!"
</p>

<p>
Then followed a shriek from Ruth, with
the explosion of a gun, and a bullet
shattered the panes in both sashes, just above
my head.
</p>

<p>
It was the voice of Abraham Clod our
Yorkshire groom, who had been out in the
evening crowshooting, and had his gun
undischarged, and who in a moment of evil
had seen me creeping along the roof of the
stable, from his attic window, where I saw
him peering forth, with a candle in one
hand, and his gun in the other.
</p>

<p>
Fearing that if I attempted to return to
my own room he might shoot me in earnest&mdash;for
I saw the fellow was quickly reloading&mdash;fearing
also to stay, lest I should place
Ruth in a false position, I lingered for a
moment irresolutely, and preferred being
taken for the housebreaker which I have
no doubt honest Clod believed me to be.
</p>

<p>
At that time I felt that I would rather
die than the honour of Ruth should
suffer!
</p>

<p>
I dropped on the roof of the stable
just as a second shot broke the tiles under
my feet, and confused by this incident, I
tumbled heavily to the ground&mdash;luckily
not into the stable-yard but into a ploughed
field.
</p>

<p>
I rose unhurt, but found that to enter
the house by the door, and to regain my
attic window, were both impossible now.
I struck across the fields, gained the
high-road, and took my way into the open
country with sorrow and rage in my heart&mdash;sorrow
for Ruth, and rage at her uncle,
whose drudge and fool I resolved no
longer to be.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
MY COUSIN TONY.
</h3>

<p>
"Under the roof of his home," says a
pleasing writer, "the boy feels <i>safe</i>; and
where in the whole realm of life, with its
bitter toils and its bitterer temptations,
will he ever feel <i>safe</i> again?"
</p>

<p>
I had no roof-tree&mdash;I had never felt
this charming safety or security&mdash;this
sublime knowledge of home, and keenly
came this conviction to my heart, as I
walked on that dark February night
along the solitary highway, with the rain
plashing in my face; for now, as if to add
to the misery of my situation, the clouds
had gathered in heaven and the rain fell
heavily.
</p>

<p>
An old fir-tree with its thick dark
foliage sheltered me for a time.  Towards
daybreak the weather became fair, and
after sleeping for some hours in a hayrick,
I set forward again.  I knew that I must
present but a sorry figure, but cared not.
I was always a lover of effect, and hoped
it might aid me in my purpose, which was
to urge Sir Basil to make some fitting
provision for me.
</p>

<p>
Alas!  I was ignorant that he had
actually written to Nathan Wylie, desiring
that the pittance allowed me should be
withdrawn, and that he was to turn me
adrift for ever.  The old minister of
Netherwood, who was with him when
this severe answer was despatched,
besought him to "be clement, and to
remember that he too had once been young."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," growled the gruff baronet, "but
it is so very long ago that I have
forgotten all about it.  Zounds!" he added,
flourishing his crutch, and smashing a
wine decanter, "I'll make that young dog
smart for this, as I made his father smart
before him!"
</p>

<p>
His orders Mr. Nathan Wylie would
cheerfully have obeyed; but in the end I
may show how the lawyer, even in the
matter of the will, <i>outwitted himself</i>, as he
might, but for his hatred of my father's
memory, and his slavish obsequiousness to
Sir Basil, have made little Ruth one day
Lady of Netherwood, and me, perhaps,
his friend for ever.
</p>

<p>
On that dull February eve I knew
nothing of all this, and so trod on for
several miles with hope in my breast&mdash;hope
that I might stir some chord of sympathy
in the withered heart of Sir Basil;
but when I drew near Netherwood, and
saw its copper vanes and antique turrets
shining above the trees, my spirit failed
me, and I thought with just indignation
of my favoured cousin Tony, of his
probable mockery at the sorry figure I
presented, and the quiet insolence of the
domestics; so I sat by the wayside inspired
only by that bitterness and irresolution
which I have described in the opening of
my story.
</p>

<p>
To Nathan Wylie's house I would never
return.
</p>

<p>
I sorrowed for poor Ruth, the sweet
companion of so many stolen interviews&mdash;the
secret love of my boyish heart.
But to what end was this sorrow?  Marriage
and the responsibilities of life had
never occurred to me.  I felt, like a boy,
that I loved Ruth dearly, and that was all.
</p>

<p>
I would go away somewhere&mdash;where, it
mattered not; I would seek a path for
myself; another time&mdash;a year hence,
perhaps&mdash;I would come back and see Ruth
again, if Fortune smiled on me.  And
with such thoughts as these, my sadness
and dejection gave place to the springy
and joyous conviction of a young heart&mdash;that
I was free&mdash;absolutely FREE&mdash;the
master of my own person&mdash;the arbiter of
my own destiny!
</p>

<p>
The wide world was all before me, and
to leave care and trouble behind should
be now my task and duty.
</p>

<p>
How was this to be achieved?  I was
the possessor only of a shilling; but
greater men than I have begun the world
with less.
</p>

<p>
As these ideas occurred to me, I perceived
in the twilight a gentleman with
two valets in livery, all well mounted,
coming along the road with their nags at
a trot.  He wore a green sporting suit,
with large gilt buttons, yellow buckskin
breeches, a jockey cap, and carried a heavy
hunting-whip.
</p>

<p>
As the two valets were not riding
behind, but were abreast with their master,
and conversing with him in loud and noisy
familiarity, I soon recognised my cousin
Tony the Foxhunter, an interview with
whom I would fain have avoided; but he
knew me at once, and came brusquely up,
checking his horse, with foam upon its
bit, so close to me, that I was nearly
knocked over.
</p>

<p>
"Zounds, cousin Basil!" said he, insolently,
and in the hearing of his valets,
"you are in a fine scrape now!"
</p>

<p>
"How, sir?" said I, sourly.
</p>

<p>
"So you have levanted from old Wylie's&mdash;or
been turned adrift&mdash;'tis all one, for
making love to his niece&mdash;eh&mdash;is this
true?"
</p>

<p>
"I have no confidences to make to you,
sir," said I, haughtily, for the idea that
I had placed Ruth&mdash;she so innocent and
pure&mdash;in a position so false, filled me with
remorse and rage.
</p>

<p>
"No confidences," stammered Tony;
"eh&mdash;damme?"
</p>

<p>
"None."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is of no use denying it;
we have just ridden from old Wylie's
this morning.  We don't blame you
for making love to the girl&mdash;she is
deuced pretty, and we all agreed it was
just what we should have done ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"<i>We</i>&mdash;who do you speak of?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Tom, Dick, and myself," he
replied, pointing to his servants; "and
no bad judges either of the points and
paces of a woman or a horse."
</p>

<p>
"Rein back from the footpath if you
please, Mr. Gauntlet, and permit me to
pass," I added, for he had me completely
hemmed against a hedge.
</p>

<p>
"Well, but what are you going, to do
<i>now</i>, for we can have no onhangers idling
about Netherwood Hall?" he exclaimed,
imperiously.
</p>

<p>
Instead of replying, I took his horse
by the bridle, thrust its head aside, and
passed disdainfully on, for I saw that he
had been dining, and was flushed alike
with wine and insolence.  Anthony was
four years older than I, and had seen
much more of the world; yet, so far as
education or accomplishments were
concerned, this pet of my grandfather was
nearly as ignorant as the grooms and
stable-boys who were his constant
companions and chosen friends, and who, in
those capacities, fleeced him of large sums
on the turf, in the tavern, and at the
gaming-table.
</p>

<p>
"Did you hear me speak, fellow?" he
thundered out, with an oath, while urging
his horse close behind me, as if to ride
me down.
</p>

<p>
Instead of turning, I quickened my
pace; but he and his grooms put spur to
their nags and followed me.
</p>

<p>
"S'blood!" exclaimed Tony, "but this
will make you <i>feel</i> if you cannot hear me!"
and he dealt me a heavy lash across the
shoulders with his hunting-whip.
</p>

<p>
With all the strength and fury that a
long sense of unmerited wrong, hardship,
neglect, and opprobrium could inspire, I
rushed upon this usurper of my patrimony,
and in a moment he was torn from his
saddle and stretched upon the highway.
I wrenched away his whip, and, twisting
the lash round my wrist, beat him soundly
with the handle.
</p>

<p>
Being stronger than I, he scrambled up,
with his green coat covered with dust and
his features inflamed by rage; he closed
with me, swearing frightfully, while his
two mounted followers assailed me in the
rear with their clubbed whips.
</p>

<p>
"Lay on, Dick! lay on, Tom!" he
cried repeatedly; "d&mdash;n him, beat the
beggarly rascal's brains out!"
</p>

<p>
I received several severe blows on the
head and shoulders, while Tony actually
strove to strangle me by twisting my
necktie; and in a combat so unequal I must
have been defeated and severely handled in
the end, had not two men who were clad in
long scarlet cloaks, and were mounted on
grey horses, interposed, and one who had
drawn his sword, exclaimed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hold, fellows, hold!  What the devil
do you mean&mdash;is it murder?  Back! on
your lives, stand back!  Why this cowardly
attack of three upon one?"
</p>

<p>
On this the valets precipitately withdrew
a little way; but Tony still grasped
my collar, and on perceiving by their dress
and accoutrements that the interposers
were two Horse Grenadiers or Dragoons,
he swore at them roundly, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What value do you put upon your
ears that you dare to accost me upon the
highway?"
</p>

<p>
"Dare?" repeated the soldier, contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dare!" exclaimed my cousin,
foaming with rage.  "Be off with you.
Do you imagine that a scurvy trooper
can scare me?  I am Anthony Gauntlet
of Netherwood Hall, and in the commission
of the peace for this county; so
begone I say, or d&mdash;n me I'll put you
both in the stocks at the nearest market
cross."
</p>

<p>
The dragoon laughed, and placed the
bare blade of his sword so close to Tony's
neck that he hastily released me and
slunk back.
</p>

<p>
"If you are what you say, sir," observed
the other dragoon, with a singular
hauteur in his tone and manner, "a justice
of the peace, you should not be brawling
thus with people on the king's highway."
</p>

<p>
"Rascal, to whom do you presume to
give advice, eh?" roared Tony, choking
with passion.
</p>

<p>
"Double rascal, to you!" thundered
out the soldier, as he wrenched away by a
single twitch of his right hand one of the
valets' whips, and lashed Tony and his
fellows so soundly, and with such rapidity,
that they scarcely knew whether they
were on the highway or in the air.
</p>

<p>
He fairly drove them off, while his
comrade, who had now sheathed his
sword, sat in his saddle and laughed
heartily as he looked on.
</p>

<p>
"Come with us, my lad," said he,
"lest those cowardly curs return and fall
on you again.  There is an inn somewhere
near this, I believe&mdash;or at least
there was when last we marched into
England."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you mean the 'Marquis of
Granby,'" said I, while applying my
handkerchief to a cut on my left temple,
which bled profusely.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that is the place I mean; we
must find our quarters there for the night.
You will share a glass with us and tell
us how this battle came to pass?"
</p>

<p>
And to this invitation I assented.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
THE INN.
</h3>

<p>
My protectors proved to be two of the
Second Dragoons, or Scots Greys&mdash;a
corporal and a private&mdash;who had been
escorting a couple of prisoners, captured
smugglers, to the Tolbooth of Dunbar,
and who were proceeding to rejoin their
regiment, which was then quartered at
the nearest market town on the English
side of the Border.
</p>

<p>
"Kirkton, what did that fellow with
the jockey cap call himself?" asked the
corporal.
</p>

<p>
"I scarcely heard; but he said he was
a justice of the peace."
</p>

<p>
"A rare one, certainly!  But he cannot
meddle with us, Tom, for we are on duty
until we rejoin.  Why did he attack you,
my lad?" asked the corporal, turning to
me; "were you poaching?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said I, angrily, though the
state of my attire perfectly warranted the
inference; "but here is the inn."
</p>

<p>
It was a common wayside hostelry,
where the Berwick stages changed horses
in those days&mdash;a two-storied house, with
a large stable-yard behind and an ivy-clad
porch in front; over the latter hung a
square signboard that creaked in the wind
on an iron rod, and bore a profile of the
Marquis of Granby in a bright red coat
and white brigadier wig, with the
information beneath, that within was "good
entertainment for man and beast."
</p>

<p>
The landlord knit his brows and muttered
something surly, under his breath
however, on seeing the two dragoons
approach; but Jack Charters, the
corporal, presented a slip of printed paper,
saying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"How are you, old boy?  Here is our
billet order."
</p>

<p>
"From whom?" growled Boniface.
</p>

<p>
"The billet master.  To-morrow it will
be from a constable, but then we shall be
in England."
</p>

<p>
Perceiving that the host scowled at the
document&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is quite correct, my dear friend,"
began the corporal, in a bantering tone,
"and quite in the terms of the Billeting
Act, which extends to all inns, livery
stables, and houses of persons selling
brandy, strong waters, cider and metheglin,
whatever the devil that may be."
</p>

<p>
And then, laughing merrily, they rode
straight into the stable-yard, where they
unsaddled, stalled and groomed their
horses with soldierlike rapidity, and
taking care to stand by while each had
its feed of corn, for they knew too much
of the world to trust to an ostler's nice
sense of honour.
</p>

<p>
Then we repaired to the bar of the inn,
where the entrance of a couple of dashing
dragoons in braided uniforms and high
bearskin caps, with all their accoutrements
rattling about them, created somewhat
of a sensation.
</p>

<p>
The rosy-cheeked barmaid smiled with
pleasure, the plump landlady curtsied
twice, even the ungracious host pushed
forward a couple of chairs&mdash;I was
permitted to find one for myself&mdash;and
several bumpkins took their long clay
pipes from their mouths, and gazed with
admiration, for the appearance of two
scarlet coats in this peaceful quarter of
Great Britain was quite an epoch in its
history.
</p>

<p>
"Bustle, landlady, if you please," said
the corporal, "and get us something to
eat by way of supper."
</p>

<p>
"Supper for three," added the private,
with a quick glance at me; "nay, no
refusal, my lad," he added, interrupting
some apology I was about to make, with
an empty purse, an aching heart, and a
burning cheek; "many a time I have
known the pleasure of supping, yea, and
dining too, at a friend's expense."
</p>

<p>
These dragoons were men who had an
air, bearing, and tone far above their
subordinate rank in the service, and there
was a mystery about this that could not
fail to interest me.
</p>

<p>
They were both bold and handsome fellows,
with eyes that looked steadily at men,
and saucily at women; slashing troopers,
with long strides, huge spurs, and steel
scabbards that made a terrible jingling.
</p>

<p>
The corporal pinched the landlady's
chin, and then gave the landlord a slap
on the back which nearly made him
swallow a foot-length of his clay pipe, as
they seated themselves.
</p>

<p>
"For shame!" said the barmaid, as our
enterprising non-commissioned officer
slipped an arm round her waist; "I fear
you are a very bad fellow."
</p>

<p>
"I would rather be that than a sad
fellow," said he; "but get us supper
quick, my pretty one; we have had a long
ride on a cold February day; but pray
don't make a fuss, my dear&mdash;for me at
least; I have long been used to take the
world as it comes."
</p>

<p>
The landlord, who had not yet digested
his mouthful of pipe, grumbled, as if to
say that "private soldiers were not the
kind of quests they were used to make a
fuss about;" but he dared not speak aloud,
for the aspect of his two unexpected
visitors rather awed him, and the female
portion of the household were all in their
favour.
</p>

<p>
A piece of roasted beef, cold, some
bread, and the materials for manufacturing
whisky toddy, were rapidly laid for us
within a snug recess that opened off the
bar.  A large fire which blazed within
the wide arched fireplace, filled the whole
apartment with a ruddy light, that was
reflected from scores of plates in a rack,
and rows of polished tin and pewter mugs
and tankards; but I selected a seat that
was in shadow, for Farmer Flail, who was
seated in an arm-chair close by, and had
wakened up at the noise of our entrance,
had dozed off to sleep, and I had no wish
to be recognised if he awoke again.
Although I was scarcely a mile from the
avenue of Netherwood, old Roger Flail
was the only person in that district who
knew me.
</p>

<p>
"The last time I was in this quarter,
a strange affair happened," said the
corporal.
</p>

<p>
"How?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Our chaplain fought a duel."
</p>

<p>
"A duel&mdash;your chaplain?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;with a cornet of Eland's Horse."
</p>

<p>
"About some point of scripture?"
</p>

<p>
"About a pretty girl, and the poor
cornet was run through the body, and
left dead, near the gate of a hall&mdash;Netherwood,
I think 'tis called."
</p>

<p>
"Were you in the Greys, then?" I
inquired.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;I was in the Dragoon Guards,
and I had <i>not</i> the honour to be a corporal,"
he replied, while a dark expression
stole over his handsome and sunburnt
face.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen service?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
The troopers laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Seen service!" repeated the corporal;
"I have seen everything&mdash;the devil
himself, I believe; but we have both smelt
powder in Flanders, and hope to do so
soon again.  Another slice of the beef, my
boy?  No more, you say?  At your age, I
could have eaten a horse behind the
saddle."
</p>

<p>
I begged to be excused; I had but little
appetite.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you can drink, at all
events," said Tom Kirkton, the private,
pushing the jug of hot water and
the whisky bottle towards me; "make
your brewage and be jolly while you
may."
</p>

<p>
Then while stirring his steaming
punch, in a lull, deep, manly voice, he
began to sing, while the corporal clanked
his spurs and clinked his glass in
tune to the favourite camp song of the
day.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How stands the glass around?<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How stands the glass around?<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May we still be found,<br />
  Content with our hard fare, my boys,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cold ground!<br />
</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cures all again."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As he concluded, Kirkton kissed the
hostess, and ordered another bottle.
</p>

<p>
"When I was in the Dragoon Guards,
at the siege of Maastricht," said the
corporal, with something sad in his tone,
"six of us sang that song one night in my
tent; before the noon of next day, there
was but one alive of all the six&mdash;myself&mdash;who
could better have been spared."
</p>

<p>
"You look downcast, my lad," said
Kirkton to me.
</p>

<p>
"Ay," added the corporal; "what is
the matter? have you done aught that is
likely to make you seek a healthier atmosphere?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't jibe the poor fellow, Jack,"
said the other on perceiving a flush of
annoyance cross my face.
</p>

<p>
"Is love at the bottom of it?"
</p>

<p>
"See how he reddens&mdash;of course it is."
</p>

<p>
"You mistake," said I, with a bitter
sigh; "my funds are at <i>zero</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Is that all?" observed the corporal,
laughing; "mine have been so many
times, for Fortune is a fickle wench; but,
egad! the dice-box, a little prize money,
a present from a pretty woman, or
something else, always made the silver rise
again to blood heat.  Well&mdash;and so your
purse is empty?"
</p>

<p>
"As you see&mdash;there is but a shilling
in it."
</p>

<p>
"When mine was thus, I took another
in the king's name, and then I had
<i>two</i>&mdash;by that stroke I exactly doubled my
fortune.  What is your profession?"
</p>

<p>
"I have none."
</p>

<p>
"Relations?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I replied, flushing to the temples
with anger.
</p>

<p>
"Friends, I should have said."
</p>

<p>
"None."
</p>

<p>
"Right!" exclaimed Corporal Charters,
bitterly; "friends and relations are often
very different people."
</p>

<p>
"Come," added Kirkton, "be one of
us&mdash;you are just a lad after old Preston's
heart."
</p>

<p>
"Old Preston&mdash;who is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Zounds, man! don't you know?  He is
Colonel of the Greys&mdash;our idol! we all
love the old boy as if he was our
father&mdash;and a father he is indeed to the whole
regiment.  Come, then, I say, be one of
us&mdash;the lads who are second to none."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Second to none!</i>" echoed the corporal,
draining his glass with enthusiasm, for
this is yet the proud motto of his
regiment; "you have still your brave heart,
boy&mdash;the king will give you a sword, and
you will ride with us against the French
as a Scots Grey dragoon."
</p>

<p>
The fumes of the potent alcohol I was
imbibing had already mounted to my
head; the idea of becoming a soldier had
frequently occurred to me, and these
troopers had only anticipated a proposal I
was about to make them.
</p>

<p>
"I will&mdash;I will!" I exclaimed, and gave
each my hand upon the promise.  Another
jorum of punch was ordered, and long
before it was finished, I found myself
wearing the corporal's grenadier cap and
aiguilettes, girded with his comrade's sword
and belt, seated on the table, and singing
most lustily, I know not what.
</p>

<p>
Then I thought of Ruth, and becoming
sad related to them my love affair, at
which they shocked me very much by
laughing loudly, and for their own amusement
made me describe her hair, eyes, hands
and voice again and again, as I had drunk
too deeply to perceive how they quizzed
me.  However after a time, it seemed to
me, that they too became maudlin, as
they rehearsed several of their tender
experiences.
</p>

<p>
"There was a time," said the Corporal,
"when I too imagined I could love a girl
for ever."
</p>

<p>
"For ever is a long time, Jack!"
</p>

<p>
"I still love with ardour&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"For a day," suggested Kirkton, and
then he added, with a tipsy air of
sentimental sadness, "love sheds a halo over
everything, and brings us nearer heaven."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!  By Jove, it nearly sent me
the <i>other</i> way once, and almost brought
me to a General Court Martial."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;you mean your scrape with&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The countess&mdash;yes&mdash;but silence on
that matter, Tom," replied the corporal,
whose face flushed, and he gave a bitter
smile.
</p>

<p>
There was a pause during which, though
very tipsy.  I surveyed him with interest,
for every line of his face expressed stern
loftiness, and then something of sadness
and mortification.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;well," said Kirkton, "drink
and forget."
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;no more for me, and you, Tom,
have had quite enough."
</p>

<p>
"Bah! another glass&mdash;for sobriety,
there is not my equal in the service&mdash;in
the Greys most certainly&mdash;"
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How stands the glass around?<br />
  For shame, ye take no care, my boys!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Of this night I remember no more, than
falling asleep&mdash;I am ashamed to say&mdash;across
the table, during Kirkton's song,
completely overcome by what I had
imbibed; and thus ended the first episode of
my new career.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
ENLISTMENT.
</h3>

<p>
Early morning brought sobriety, with a
headache, a burning thirst, and deep reflection.
</p>

<p>
I had enlisted as a private dragoon: I,
the heir to a baronetcy; but it was a
baronetcy that would not bring with it an
acre of land, and by the enmity of its
present possessors, I was then on the verge of
total want.  What other path was open
to me than this, which it seemed as if the
hand of destiny now indicated?
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes," thought I, "it is the
<i>dictum</i> of fate!"
</p>

<p>
My position had been one of extreme
difficulty.  I could not dig, and to
beg&mdash;even from Sir Basil&mdash;I was ashamed;
besides, I had a spirit that revolted at the
idea of eating bread that was won either
by falsehood or servility.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis done!" said I, thinking aloud, "in
the plain red coat of a trooper, none will
ever discover Basil Gauntlet&mdash;the disinherited
heir of Nether wood!"
</p>

<p>
"So you are still resolved to be one of
us?" said Charters, when we met early in
the morning.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well; life is a lottery&mdash;let us go
and draw," he observed, figuratively.
</p>

<p>
"I would rather go and drink," added
Kirkton, who, after our late potations,
looked rather red about the eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Try a dram&mdash;and then hey for the
road; but we must have our new comrade
attested.  Landlord, where is a justice of
the peace to be found?"
</p>

<p>
"Plague on them&mdash;they're thick as
blackberries on both sides o' the Border,"
growled the host.
</p>

<p>
"For one, there is Nathan Wylie, the
writer at&mdash;" began the hostess.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;no&mdash;I go not before <i>him</i>!" said
I, with a pang of sorrow in my heart, as
I thought of Ruth, whose sweet image
came upbraidingly to my memory.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;who next?" asked the corporal,
while buckling on his sword.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Basil Gauntlet, at the hall&mdash;or his
nephew, the young Laird that is to be."
</p>

<p>
"Worse still!" I exclaimed, passionately;
"I shall not go before them either."
</p>

<p>
"Zounds, but you are hard to please,"
said Charters as he eyed me keenly, but
with something of commiseration too.
"What is your name?"
</p>

<p>
"That I shall tell the magistrate," I
replied, evasively, not having yet thought
of a <i>nom de guerre</i>.  Then the corporal
asked me&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Is this Sir Basil a relation, a
connection, or what?"
</p>

<p>
The landlord laughed while eyeing my
scurvy appearance, as if he thought it very
unlikely I could be either; my breast
burned with suppressed mortification and
rage, but I continued calmly,
</p>

<p>
"It matters little&mdash;I go not before him."
</p>

<p>
"You are regularly enlisted, my lad,"
said the corporal, soothingly, "and must
go before some one."
</p>

<p>
"Try the rector," said I.
</p>

<p>
"We have no rectors in Scotland,"
said the landlord, bluntly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there is one over the Border, a
few miles from this&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"On the road to Rothbury&mdash;good,"
said Charters.
</p>

<p>
"He is a justice of the peace, and such
a one!  Odsbud! he sent a child, four
years old, to hard labour for having a
tame pheasant for a pet."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"As a poacher," added Boniface, with
a rough malediction.
</p>

<p>
"Will <i>he</i> do?" asked the Corporal.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said I, briefly; "and now let us
begone."
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!  Now, Kirkton&mdash;brandy and
water&mdash;boot and saddle, and let us be off.
Our new comrade shall share our horses
alternately, for we have nearly twenty
miles to travel to-day before we reach
head-quarters."
</p>

<p>
As the troopers brought from the stable
to the inn door their two stately grey
chargers, in all the trappings of a heavy
dragoon regiment, with saddle-cloth,
scarlet valise, long holsters, powerful
bits, and chain bridles, an old horse that
was passing, heavily laden with the wares
of an itinerant basket-maker, pricked up
his ears, and switched his short shorn
tail, and seemed to eye us wistfully.
</p>

<p>
"That is an old trooper," said Kirkton;
"by Jove, the poor animal actually
recognises our red coats, and, doubtless, his
heart warms to the colour.  Landlord, a
feed of oats, and here is the money for
it&mdash;a feed of oats for the old nag-tailed
trooper.  He has been a heavy dragoon
horse&mdash;see here are the white spots where
the carbine has galled him.  Well, well! it
makes one sad to think that the dashing
horse, which has perhaps borne a brave
fellow in many a charge, which has fed
from his hand, and slept beside him in
the bivouac, comes down to the sand cart
and knacker's yard at last!"
</p>

<p>
"After all, his rider's fate is seldom
better in the end," said the corporal,
"and I don't think either you or I, Tom,
will have our tombs in Westminster
Abbey.  But bring the brandy; confound
care and reflection; let us live while we
can and be jolly, too!"
</p>

<p>
I rode each of their horses alternately
after we crossed the Border, as we
proceeded southward, along the road towards
the Rectory.
</p>

<p>
My comrades were rather silent now,
and I was often left to my own reflections.
The day was gloomy and lowering, and
the wind came in gusts; dark clouds
rolled in masses across the grey, sullen
sky; the distant Cheviot hills looked
brown and sombre; but nature's aspect
failed to impress me with gloom as on
the preceding day.
</p>

<p>
I felt a glow of new enthusiasm kindling
in my heart.  The hopes inspired by
ambition, pride, and all a boy's visions of
military pomp and glory, grew strong
within me.  To wear a fine uniform&mdash;to
ride a showy horse&mdash;to be a captain in a
year&mdash;to return to the village&mdash;to marry
Ruth&mdash;and to flaunt my finery before the
people, were my most prominent ideas.
A year?  Amid all this, I remembered
that my dashing comrade, Jack Charters,
spoke of having been a soldier for ten
years, and was only a corporal still!
</p>

<p>
This was far from encouraging; but
then I should be certain to prove so much
more sober, steady, and industrious than
Jack; and so I rode on scheming out
my future career, with great brilliance
and rapidity, and much to my own satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
I was full of such thoughts when we
reached the gate of the Rectory, which
was a quaint old building, having its
deeply embayed and mullioned windows
nearly hidden by luxuriant masses of
ivy, vine and clematis.  It was small, and
covered simply with bright yellow thatch;
but its walls were thick and strong, though
they had often been subjected to fire by
the invading Scots, in the stormy times
of old.
</p>

<p>
We left the horses at the gothic porch,
and, by a servant in livery, were ushered
into the library, where the Rector was
seated at luncheon, with a decanter of
port before him, and he had been evidently
dozing over his books and papers.
</p>

<p>
To attest recruits at once, without the
many formalities of medical inspections
and so forth, was common in those
days, and for long after.  Had it been
otherwise, the public would never have
been favoured with the memoirs of
Phœbe Hassel, who served seven years in
H. M. 5th Foot, or of Mrs. Christian
Davis, another woman, who served in all
the battles of Marlborough, as a trooper
in the Scots Greys, who had her head
fractured by the splinter of a shell at
Ramillies, and who enjoyed a pension of
one shilling per diem till she died, and
was buried with military honours in the
ground belonging to Chelsea Hospital.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "Records of the Scots Greys," pp. 49-51.
Phœbe Hassel was alive at Brighton in 1821.  She
served in the West Indies, and at Gibraltar.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Rector was a fine old gentleman,
with a mild and rubicund visage; and he
had been, I knew, my father's early friend
and schoolfellow; so I resolved to enter the
service under some such name as Smith
or Brown instead of my own.
</p>

<p>
He started from his waking dream as
the two dragoons clattered in.  I can still
see, in memory, that quaint old library in
which he received us, with its dark oak
shelves of goodly folios and quartos, in calf
bindings, dark and brown; some partial
gleams of sunlight streaming through the
lozenged window panes and carved stone
mullions fell on the old man's shining
head and scattered silver hairs&mdash;on the
floor of polished oak, on the furniture of
walnut wood, and on the russet tints that
time had cast over everything.
</p>

<p>
"What bring you here, my friends&mdash;not
a deserter&mdash;this boy?" stammered
the Rector, with sadness and pity in his
eye and tone, while wheeling his elbow
chair half round.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, reverend sir, a recruit,"
replied Charters, with a military salute;
"a recruit whom we wish you to attest."
</p>

<p>
"That slender boy for the cavalry!"
exclaimed the Rector.
</p>

<p>
"He will do excellently for the troop
of light horse which Captain Lindsay of
ours is raising," suggested Kirkton.
</p>

<p>
I was then slightly formed, and looked,
I knew, wan, dejected, and poor.  The
good rector surveyed me through his
gold-rimmed spectacles with an unmistakeable
expression of pity on his benign
and fatherly face; after a pause&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Have you considered this matter
well?" he asked; "but you look weary,
my poor lad! take some wine&mdash;there are
glasses on the buffet&mdash;corporal, help yourself."
</p>

<p>
"I thank your Reverence," said Charters,
who never required a second invitation
of this kind, and so filled our
glasses with port&mdash;his own twice in
succession, and drank, muttering, "Good
stuff this!  I've tasted worse&mdash;in a palace
too."
</p>

<p>
"Have you weighed well the step you
are about to take?" continued the rector,
impressively.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said I, firmly.
</p>

<p>
"But your parents&mdash;&mdash;" he urged
gently: "think of them."
</p>

<p>
"I have none," said I, in tones that
faltered as my heart swelled with emotion,
and the old man shook his head sadly.
</p>

<p>
"You will never be able to undergo
the hardships of foreign service," said he,
shaking his head.
</p>

<p>
"Then I will help to fill the trenches,"
said I, with that spirit of bravado which
we so often feel or assume in youth.
</p>

<p>
The corporal said something approvingly;
then the rector sighed, as he
dipped a pen in an inkhorn, and placed
on his desk a printed document, preparatory
to filling up the blanks, or fifteen
replies to questions always asked of a
recruit at attestation.
</p>

<p>
"What is your name?" he began.
</p>

<p>
Now it was that my heart failed me,
and the question had to be repeated three
times, as I could not tell an untruth.
</p>

<p>
"Do you hear me," he added, gently;
"your name?"
</p>

<p>
"Basil Gauntlet."
</p>

<p>
He threw down the pen and half rose
from his chair.
</p>

<p>
"The son of Major Gauntlet, of
Granby's Dragoons?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I replied, while both of the
soldiers turned, and faced me inquiringly,
and with unconcealed interest in their
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Basil," exclaimed the rector, who
knew at once both me and my story,
"this is sad, most sad.  Consider, I pray
you, consider well.  I have some right to
say this, for your father was one of my
dearest and earliest friends."
</p>

<p>
"Sir, you know how <i>his</i> father has
treated me; thus, that which might have
been dire necessity at first, has now
become my choice.  I am resolved to be
a soldier, so I beg of you to hasten over
this most mortifying scene, and let me
begone."
</p>

<p>
In the irritation I felt at my position,
I spoke somewhat sternly, even ungraciously,
to this good man; so Charters
came to my aid, and urged that time
pressed, so the formal oath was
administered, which bound me "faithfully and
honestly to defend his Majesty King
George, his heirs and successors, in
person, crown, and dignity, against all
enemies, and to obey all the orders of his
Majesty, his heirs and successors, and of
the generals and officers set over me," &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
This oath made me irrevocably a soldier.
</p>

<p>
The old rector shook my hand, and his
voice faltered, for he felt more emotion
than I did, as he accompanied us to the
porch of his house, where he kindly bade
us adieu.
</p>

<p>
"We shall have a most disastrous war
ere long," said he, "and I may say in the
words of Goldsmith, 'Go, my boy, and if
you fall, though distant, exposed and
unwept for a time, by those who love you, the
most precious tears are those with which
Heaven bedews the unburied head of the
soldier.'  Farewell, my friends.  God bless
you!"
</p>

<p>
"We thank you, sir," replied Charters,
with a profound salute, and with an air
that had something lofty and noble in
it, as he sprang on his horse and gathered
up his reins; "a good man's blessing can
never be given in vain, especially to such
reckless dogs as we are; but, believe me,
sir, that though but poor soldiers now,
my comrades and I can never forget that
we have been, and may again be, <i>gentlemen</i>!"
</p>

<p>
We were once more on the open highway.
I was glad the scene was over, but
I still seemed to see the mild and benevolent
face of the old rector, and to hear
his parting words.
</p>

<p>
"So we have really had the honour of
enlisting the heir to a baronetcy?" said
Kirkton.  "You were right to come with
us.  I thought you were meant for better
things than to be squire to a knight of the
bluebag."
</p>

<p>
"What is that?"
</p>

<p>
"A lawyer.  Were we quartered in
Bath your story would make your fortune.
Any heiress would marry you for
the prospect of the title."
</p>

<p>
"That is flattering," said I; and then
thinking of Ruth, I added, "Why not for
love?"
</p>

<p>
"Bah!" said Charters, "people don't
marry for that, except in plays and
novels."
</p>

<p>
"Jack, you are a misanthrope in spite
of yourself," said Kirkton; "but as this
youth is the heir to a baronetcy&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I beg to have your promises of keeping
the matter a secret when we reach
the regiment?" said I, with great
earnestness.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked they.
</p>

<p>
"Because I owe nothing to my family,
and hate them as they hate me&mdash;the
living at least.  Whatever I may do to
gain honour or promotion, will never be
acknowledged by my comrades, who will
be certain to attribute success to the
fortuitous circumstance of family and
name."
</p>

<p>
"Egad! you are right, boy, and I love
and respect your spirit," said Charters.
"I have more than once seen a poor
fellow gain the ill-will and malevolence of
his comrades for being better born or
better bred than those among whom his
lot was cast, and thus bitterness came
with prosperity."
</p>

<p>
"Your solemn pledge, then, that you
will keep my secret?" said I, earnestly.
</p>

<p>
They promised, and I may add that
the worthy fellows never betrayed it; but
they too had each a secret, which they
confided to me as we sat together over a
glass of beer in a wayside tavern, a few
miles from Rothbury.
</p>

<p>
"If I had not had the misfortune to
have been born a genius, I should perhaps
never have been a soldier," said Kirkton.
</p>

<p>
"A genius&mdash;you?" exclaimed the
corporal, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry am I to say it, for 'tis the fate
of geniuses to be restless and
unfortunate.  True; Boetus, who wrote on
the battle of Philippi, died in prison;
Plautus was a baker's drudge and turned
a hand-mill; Terentius Publius was the
slave of a Roman senator&mdash;&mdash;.  And I,
Thomas Kirkton, am a private in the Scots
Greys!"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis an ungrateful world, my friends,"
added the other, with an air of
tragi-comedy that made us both laugh.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
MY COMRADES.
</h3>

<p>
Tom Kirkton was the son of a thrifty and
prudent Scottish clergyman, who had
educated him for the Church, in the hope
that he might be his assistant and
successor; but the wild life led by Tom when
at college, a natural impetuosity of temper,
a genius for everything but application&mdash;rash
adventures and excitements&mdash;with
stories of nights spent in gambling and
carousing, and rumours of various <i>intrigues
d'amour</i>, led to his formal expulsion by the
Reverend Principal, and ultimately drove
him into the ranks of the Scots Greys.
</p>

<p>
Time and experience had somewhat
tempered the reckless tenor of his ways,
and, though his boisterous manner was
rather startling at times, I could not but
deem myself fortunate in having a
companion so well educated as he.
</p>

<p>
The story of Charters was indeed a
singular one.
</p>

<p>
Five miles north-east of Dumfries there
stands a tall, square, and ancient fortress
called the Castle of Amisfield, between the
two head streams of the Lochar.  For
centuries this great tower had been the
stronghold and residence of the Scoto-Norman
family of Charters, of whom my
comrade, the corporal, was the last
representative.
</p>

<p>
In that tower he was born and reared,
until he joined the army as an officer.
At the age of eighteen he found himself
a lieutenant in the 1st Dragoon Guards,
and the inheritor of a splendid fortune,
which he lavished in London with the
reckless prodigality of a Timon.  He was
at that time on leave of absence, seeking
a transfer into a light dragoon regiment.
</p>

<p>
When rambling one night near Hydepark
Corner, he heard the cries of a lady
whose carriage had been stopped by
footpads.  He hurried to her rescue, and
narrowly escaped a pistol-shot; but, closing
with the fellow who fired it, struck him
down, on which his companions fled,
leaving Charters in possession of the field
of battle.
</p>

<p>
The rescued lady proved to be a foreigner
of very attractive face and figure, with
bright blue eyes, and a profusion of fair
hair, amid which, as well as on her neck
and arms, many diamonds were sparkling.
She was richly dressed, and was returning,
apparently, from a ball.
</p>

<p>
"You will permit me, madam, to escort
you home?" said Charters, bowing, hat in
hand.
</p>

<p>
She entreated that he would not give
himself so much trouble.
</p>

<p>
"But, madam," urged Charters, "those
fellows may return, and I cannot rest until
I know that you are safe in your own
residence."
</p>

<p>
"But which is your way, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Your way is mine, madam&mdash;nay, I
insist upon it."  And with great gallantry
he sprang up beside the servant on the
footboard behind the carriage, and the
lady, pleased, perhaps, to see that he was
a handsome young man, made no further
objection to his escort.
</p>

<p>
"Drive home," said she.
</p>

<p>
Pleased with the adventure, and considerably
attracted by the personal charms
of the lady, especially by her broken
English, which had a child-like lisp in its
sound, Charters slipped a handsome
<i>douceur</i> into the hand of the footman as
the carriage rumbled along, and asked the
name of his lady; but the man proved to
be a foreigner also, and replied in German,
of which the questioner knew not a word.
</p>

<p>
"Good!" said Charters; "the mystery
increases."
</p>

<p>
Indeed it grew greater still when the
carriage, after traversing the Park by the
bank of the Serpentine, drew up before
the lighted portal of a large and handsome
edifice of brick, having no less than three
spacious quadrangles, ornamented with
columns, quoins, and elaborate cornices
of stone.  Charters immediately recognised
Kensington Palace.  Save the porch&mdash;near
which stood two sentinels of the Foot
Guards in their boxes&mdash;and one or two
windows, the whole façade of the
building was enveloped in darkness, for
the king was absent, having gone on
what proved to be his last visit to
Hanover.
</p>

<p>
Charters assisted the fair unknown to
alight, and led her to the door of the
palace, with an air of confidence so perfect,
that anyone might have supposed the
house to be his own.  Then she perceived
that he wore the Windsor uniform, at that
time the usual dress of all officers when
on leave or on half-pay.  Attracted, no
doubt, by his air, which, though gentle
and soft to her, was proud, dashing, and
careless, she paused upon the threshold to
thank him for his ready courage and
escort&mdash;then, after a little pretty hesitation,
added, that she could not think of
permitting him to retire without joining her
at supper.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot but accept, madam," said he,
kissing her right hand, from which she had
coquettishly drawn the kid glove, as if,
perhaps, to show its beauty.
</p>

<p>
"You have no fear?" she whispered,
with a soft side-glance in her clear blue
eye, as she took his proffered arm.
</p>

<p>
"None, madam; moreover, I am the
foe of all restraint and prejudice."
</p>

<p>
"Then you should not have become a
soldier."
</p>

<p>
"I can understand the restraints of the
service, but I cannot abide the shallow
and hackneyed usages of society."
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Charters that her little
hand pressed his arm rather palpably at
that moment, and she whispered&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"If seen here&mdash;if known&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"By whom?" asked Charters, hastily.
"You have no husband, I hope?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;nor lover&mdash;none here at least,"
replied the lady, laughing, as she threw
off her white silk capuchin or hood, and
then Charters saw quite enough of fair
ringlets, and a neck and shoulders of great
beauty and wondrous delicacy, to remove
any scruples or fears which had occurred
to him.  He was in for an adventure
now, and felt himself compelled to go
through with it.  A retreat was not to
be thought of.
</p>

<p>
"By what name am I to have the
honour of addressing you?" asked Charters,
in a half-whisper, as they sat down to
supper, with the German valet in close
attendance, and in a snug little room in
that portion of the palace which had
been built by the Lord Chancellor Finch.
It was panelled and richly gilded, and
from the walls one or two dark Holbeins
looked grimly down upon their <i>tête-à-tête</i>.
"Pray tell me, madam," he urged; "for
I am dying of curiosity."
</p>

<p>
"Call me Sophia," said the lady, looking
down for a moment, and then bending her
bright eyes on him smilingly; "and you?"
she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I am Lieutenant Charters, of the 1st
Dragoon Guards," replied the other.
"Sophia?" he repeated, in a soft, low
voice, as he mentally ran over all the
names of the female members of the royal
family, for he concluded that his new
friend must be a princess at least.  Thus
some very wild ideas began to float
through his busy brain; but at that
moment he could remember no Sophia
among all the ladies who were about the
Court.
</p>

<p>
Amid all the rings that glittered on her
hand&mdash;and a beautiful little hand it was&mdash;he
could see no plain marriage hoop; so
his mind felt considerably relieved on that
score.  The valet in attendance wore the
royal livery; but an earl's coronet and
the letter Y were on all the plate, and
graven somewhat ostentatiously, too.
</p>

<p>
Though some years his senior, this
lady, by the charm of her manner,
her wit, and conversation, bewildered
Charters so much, that in less than an
hour he was desperately in love with her;
but she seemed resolved to preserve her
incognita, and they separated, with an
arrangement, however, to meet next day
in Hyde Park, at an early hour, and before
it was thronged by promenaders.
</p>

<p>
In short, they met frequently there,
and oftener still in the green alleys of old
Kensington Gardens&mdash;I mean that portion
of them which was laid out by Wise, the
gardener of Queen Anne; and Charters'
love for his unknown became a confirmed
passion, so much so that he thought of
visiting the Horse Guards and withdrawing
his application for a transfer to
a light dragoon regiment, as he now
anticipated with dread a separation from his
captivating Sophia.
</p>

<p>
As she expressed a wish to visit the
opera one night, he begged permission to
escort her there; and on their entrance all
eyes were turned towards them.  Her fine
hair was dressed to perfection; her bright
eyes sparkled; her soft cheek was flushed
with pleasure, and the richness of her
dress and the splendour of her diamonds
so enhanced her fair and remarkable
beauty, that Charters was enchanted and
felt proud of her.
</p>

<p>
Yet he could not conceal from himself
that she was the object of more than
common&mdash;and more than well-bred&mdash;interest.
The ladies whispered to each
other behind their fans, and some of
the gentlemen looked at Sophia so
boldly and so laughingly, that Charters felt
inclined to teach them a rough lesson, if
he could but fix upon one or two in
particular.
</p>

<p>
They had seats next the royal box,
which was empty, as the king was still
absent, though expected to arrive at
St. James's next day.
</p>

<p>
The opera over, Charters escorted Sophia
to her carriage, and proposed to
accompany her home, for he was resolved to
remain in a state of suspense no longer.
If her rank was so great that she
concealed her name from him, why
accompany him to the opera, where she was
certain of recognition?  The mystery was
now greater than ever!
</p>

<p>
On attempting to step into her carriage
she said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You must not&mdash;you cannot come with
me&mdash;to-night at least."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" he asked, with surprise.
</p>

<p>
"The king returns to-morrow from
Hanover."
</p>

<p>
"The king!" repeated Charters, in a
bewildered manner.  "What has he to
do with the love I bear you&mdash;the love you
have made me so happy by accepting."
</p>

<p>
"Alas!  I cannot tell you here; but we
must meet no more," said she, sighing
deeply.
</p>

<p>
The pressure of carriages compelled
them to separate.  Sophia sank back upon
her cushioned seat, and covered her face
with her handkerchief, as if she wept
bitterly.  The heart of Charters was filled
with acute sorrow and vague alarm; but
could he have seen her fair little face, he
would have found it convulsed with&mdash;<i>laughter</i>!
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, Charters! so your fair one is
gone?" said some one whose voice he
recognised; and turning angrily, he found
himself face to face with Frederick Shirley,
a cornet of his own regiment.  "A rare
scrape you are in!" the cornet added, with
a loud laugh.
</p>

<p>
"How so, sir?" asked Charters, sharply.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth tempted you to appear
in an opera box with that woman?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>That</i> woman?" he repeated, fiercely;
"what woman&mdash;who?"
</p>

<p>
"She who just left you in that absurd
turn out&mdash;for it is absurd&mdash;horses,
harness, and all," continued the unabashed
Shirley; "coronets, plating, and panels."
</p>

<p>
"Who is she?" asked Charters, somewhat
crestfallen.
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;is it possible that you do not
know?" queried Shirley, with an air of
utter bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"I know that she is adorable, and is
called Sophia&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Sophia Amelia de Walmoden,
Countess of Yarmouth, and bosom friend of
his majesty the king!" added Shirley,
with another burst of laughter, as he took
the arm of Charters and led him away.
</p>

<p>
Charters was stupified!
</p>

<p>
He had been thus fooled by the mere mistress
of this very unattractive king, some of
whose "amorous sallies" in Hanover had
excited <i>her jealousy</i>, and she was now
anxious to revenge herself by exciting his
in turn; for she was certain that the
Defender of the Faith would hear of her
appearance at the opera with a handsome
young cavalry officer.  So Charters
trembled with rage at the thought of his own
folly, and began to school himself&mdash;however
difficult and unpalatable the task&mdash;to
hate her as much as he had formerly
loved her.
</p>

<p>
Shirley's laughter galled him to the
soul at first; but afterwards, over their
wine, he showed about a dozen of little
pink and peagreen notes, which he had
received from his faithless Walmoden, all
signed "Sophia."
</p>

<p>
His appearance in public with the
Countess of Yarmouth had given rise to
much speculation and gossip in the
vicinity of Kensington Palace, and
St. James's too; and Shirley was unwise
enough to boast frequently of having seen
the notes in the possession of Charters;
consequently, the latter soon found a
secret influence at work against him at
headquarters, and that there was little
chance of obtaining either a transfer to
another corps, or an extension of leave.
This was unpleasant, as his funds were so
much impaired by extravagance, that he
could scarcely rejoin the Dragoon Guards.
</p>

<p>
While he was in this dilemma, Shirley
called at his hotel one morning, and
mentioned in confidence, that if he would
give up Walmoden's letters, he would find,
on looking at the <i>Gazette</i>, the position of
his affairs materially altered.
</p>

<p>
Further information he stated himself
to be unable, as yet, to afford; so poor
Charters, though not of a temper to be
threatened even by the king, was scared
by the thought of his creditors, and
gave up the letters of the Countess to
Shirley.
</p>

<p>
Impatiently he waited for the next
<i>Gazette</i>; but on opening it, how great was
his astonishment and rage to find the
following notice:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"1st Dragoon Guards.  Cornet Frederick
Shirley to be Lieutenant, <i>vice</i> Charters,
<i>who resigns</i>!"
</p>

<p>
For some time he could scarcely believe
his eyesight.  Then he called for his horse
and rode to the Horse Guards; but neither
the Commander-in-Chief nor the military
secretary would receive him, and for weeks
he remained a prey to despair and
mortification.  He sought in vain for the
perfidious Shirley, who kept sedulously
out of his way, and had now left
London.
</p>

<p>
"My commission, the pride of my
heart, was gone," said Charters with a
sigh, as he concluded his story; "and by
my own folly and extravagance, together
with the active assistance of others, my
fortune was nearly gone too.  Friends
disappeared as my purse emptied, and ere
long I knew not what to do, or whither
to turn me.
</p>

<p>
"As for Shirley, my lieutenancy availed
him but little, as he was dismissed from
the service soon after for declining to <i>go
out</i> with a brother officer.  Gradually he
became a gambler, a blackleg&mdash;in fact, a
common robber in London, and his fate
was a fearful one; so in my heart, I now
forgive him.
</p>

<p>
"Was he executed?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Worse.  His brother, Sir Jasper
Shirley, being out of town, at his place
in Hants, the household plate was lodged,
as usual, at his banker's.  It was valuable,
for among it was a princely service he had
received from the empress-queen when he
was our Ambassador at Vienna; and when
a sudden order came to the wary old
butler, desiring him to get it all out, as
Sir Jasper was returning to town, he
showed the letter to my ci-devant friend,
Fred Shirley, who said 'it was all right,
as his brother would be in London to-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
"The butler, however, still had his
secret fears; and after bringing home the
plate, borrowed from a friend a bulldog&mdash;a
surly and savage brute of great
strength and ferocity, which he chained
to the chest over night.
</p>

<p>
"Shortly before daybreak, a dreadful
noise was heard in the apartment where
the plate lay.  Lights were procured&mdash;the
butler and other servants hurried to
the place, and found that a window had
been forced by the usual implements of a
housebreaker, who lay on the floor dead, but
still warm, and in a pool of blood, for his
throat and tongue were completely torn
out by the fangs of the ferocious dog; and
who think you he proved to be?  Sir
Jasper's younger brother&mdash;Frederick
Shirley.
</p>

<p>
"So," added Charters, through his
clenched teeth, "so perished he who
betrayed me!
</p>

<p>
"Drinking, gambling, and reckless
dissipation among the <i>condottieri</i> of London
society, soon brought me like the prodigal
of old to the husks and the swine trough;
till one day, when my better angel
triumphed over the evil spirit who had
guided me so long, I conceived the
idea of endeavouring to regain, by
mere force of merit, the commission
of which I had been so lawlessly deprived.
</p>

<p>
"Inspired by this resolution, so
consistent with my warm and sanguine
temperament, I enlisted in the Scots Greys;
but my evil genius still follows me, for
I have never got beyond the rank of
corporal.
</p>

<p>
"I am not the man I once was, and
may never rise higher.  Perhaps I am
too reckless, too much soured in temper,
and too much of a misanthrope, to deserve
a commission, or it may be that the
secret vengeance of the king and his
devil of a Walmoden, still pursues me
even here.  I cannot see my future, but,
happily,

CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
HEAD QUARTERS.
</h3>

<p>
Having now related how I became a
soldier, almost in desperation and
misanthropy, I shall soon show how such
emotions gave place to better, to braver,
and to higher aspirations, fanned by that
blessed <i>hope</i> which never dies in the heart
of youth.
</p>

<p>
I learned&mdash;but not for a long time after
this period&mdash;that when news of the step
I had taken was brought by the sorrowing
old Rector to Netherwood, it gave great
satisfaction to my worthy grandfather,
and still more to my affectionate cousin
Tony, who drained a full bumper to the
health of the Frenchman whose bullet
should rid them of me for ever; and then
Sir Basil was actually barbarous enough
to shake him by the hand and say&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Zounds!  Tony, my boy, you may be
heir to my title as well as acres, and die a
baronet yet!"
</p>

<p>
After travelling eighteen miles we
reached Rothbury, a quaint old market
town of Northumberland, pleasantly
situated in a valley overlooked by a lofty
ridge of rocks.  Our head-quarters were
here, but some of our troops were billeted
at Bickerton, Caistron, and other
townships of the parish.
</p>

<p>
The Coquet flowed through the town,
and every morning one of our first duties
was to take our horses there to water,
which was done by beat of kettledrum, for
as yet the Greys, being Horse Grenadiers,
had no brass trumpets.
</p>

<p>
On the morning after our arrival at
Rothbury, I was brought before my
commanding officer, Colonel George Preston.
Tall, handsome, and venerable in aspect,
he was a noble veteran officer, though
somewhat of an eccentric character in his
way.  He was now far advanced in life,
and had been from his boyhood in the
Scots Greys, having entered the regiment
as a kettledrummer in the last years of
Queen Anne.
</p>

<p>
He was a captain at the battle of Val,
where, at the head of only thirty Greys,
he made so furious a charge upon a great
body of French cavalry, that he routed
and drove them fairly off the field.  He
then pulled out his purse, and gave each
trooper a ducat with his left hand, for his
<i>right</i> was so swollen by the vigorous use
he had made of his broad sword, that the
hilt had to be sawn in two by the
regimental armourer before he could be
released from it.
</p>

<p>
Under his old-fashioned scarlet uniform,
which was cut somewhat in the mode of
Queen Anne's days, he wore a <i>buff coat</i>,
and this was, no doubt, the last appearance
of such a garment in any European army.
</p>

<p>
He received me gravely but kindly, and said,
</p>

<p>
"So, boy, you have resolved to become
a soldier?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, noble sir," said I; for as Charters
had informed me, this was then the mode
of addressing the commanding officer of a
regiment.
</p>

<p>
"You are very young, and seem somewhat
different from the common run of
our recruits.  Your name is rather
uncommon, too.  I presume that your
parents&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"They are in their graves.  I have
none to advise or regret me&mdash;none whom
I can regret."
</p>

<p>
(Did no thought of Poor Ruth arrest
this sweeping speech?)
</p>

<p>
"Good! you are then the best of food
for gunpowder.  Your age&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am about eighteen, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You look older than that&mdash;in face,
especially."
</p>

<p>
"Sir, those who have undergone such
years as I have, frequently do so."
</p>

<p>
In truth, I looked older than my age.
My figure was tall, well formed and
developed, while my face had a matured
expression, and somewhat resolute aspect,
especially about the eyes.  Colonel Preston,
though a stern man, and a strict disciplinarian,
felt a deep interest and pride in
his regiment, and thus he narrowly
examined every recruit before passing him
into the ranks, and every man's name and
character there, were graven on his
memory.
</p>

<p>
"I like both your spirit and bearing,
boy," said he.  "Sixty years ago, I was a
poor and penniless lad, so I e'en became a
private trooper in the Scots Greys, and
behold me now!  I am Lieutenant-Colonel
of the regiment, and hope, please God, to
die a General, and go to my grave under
a salute of cannon.  Ere long, my lads,"
he continued to me, and several other
recruits, who had just been ushered
into the Orderly room, "we must all be
in France or Germany, and there we shall
find what the fortune of war has in store
for us.  Remember that the sword of a
brave man is always sharp, but that of a
coward for ever wants grinding!  Stand
by me, my lads, and I shall never fail
you, and in me you see a living example
of the reward that may await sobriety,
steadiness, and a strict obedience to orders.
Put Basil Gauntlet into Captain Lindsay's
troop; attach the rest to Captain
Cunninghame's.  The tailor and the
roughrider will soon make dragoons of them
all."
</p>

<p>
I was conducted to my billet.  Fortunately
it was in the same tavern where
Kirkton and Charters were quartered, and
with them I shared the first instalment of
my pay, which at that time was small
enough, when a cornet had but a half-crown
per diem, and a lieutenant-colonel
of Dragoons only eight shillings and six-pence!
</p>

<p>
My bounty-money was soon dissipated,
for under pretence of fraternising with
me, or teaching me many matters that
might be useful, several of those rogues
who are usually known in barracks as
"old soldiers," or "knowing ones," stuck
close to me and to the other recruits, so
long as our cash lasted.
</p>

<p>
The next day saw me arrayed in full
uniform.  The largest mirror in the tavern
(it measured only six inches each way) by
no means afforded me sufficient scope for
the admiration of my own person in this
new attire; though I could view it, when
reflected at full length, in the shop-windows,
while passing along the streets,
into which I at once issued, as Kirkton
said, "to exhibit my war-paint."
</p>

<p>
In those days&mdash;this was in the year
before we fought at Minden&mdash;the Greys
wore double-breasted scarlet coats, lined
with blue, having slit sleeves; long slashed
pockets were in each skirt, and a white
worsted aiguilette dangled from the right
shoulder.  We wore long jack-boots, and
tall grenadier caps, with the Scottish
Thistle and circle of St. Andrew in front.
Our cloaks were scarlet lined with blue
shalloon, and in front they had rows of
large flat buttons set two and two, on
white frogs, or loops of braid.  On our
collars we wore a grenade in memory that
at its formation, a portion of the regiment
had been armed with that formidable
weapon, the same as the Scots Horse
Grenadier Guards.
</p>

<p>
Everywhere the proud motto of the
corps met my eye; on the standards and
kettledrums, on our caps, carbines, and
pistol-barrels, and on the blades of our
long straight broadswords, I read the
words&mdash;
</p>

<p class="t3">
SECOND TO NONE!
</p>

<p class="noindent">
That short sentence seemed full of haughty
spirit; it gave me a new life, and fired
my heart with lofty inspirations.  I
repeated it, dreamed and pondered over
it, and as our departure for the seat of
war was daily looked for, I longed for
active service, and for the peril and
adventure ever consequent thereto.
</p>

<p>
The brusque manners, rough words,
oaths and expletives used by some of my
comrades, certainly shocked and somewhat
blunted my chivalry.  To be sure all
gentlemen then swore to their hearts
content: and I am sorry to say the army
carried the fashion to an extreme, and
there a quiet fellow was sure to be
mocked and stigmatized as a methodist or
quaker.
</p>

<p>
In all the many wars which succeeded
its first formation, when it was raised by
Sir Thomas Dalyell and Graham of
Claverhouse, in 1678, to fight against the
hapless covenanters, our regiment had
borne a great and glorious part.  At the
battle of Drumclog and at Airsmoss
where Richard Cameron the field-preacher
fell, the Greys were, unhappily, the terror
of their own countrymen; and even now,
after the lapse of so many generations,
traditions of those dark days still lingered
in our ranks&mdash;handed orally down from
veteran to recruit.
</p>

<p>
In better times they had served in the
wars of Anne and of the earlier Georges,
and always with honour, for in every
campaign they captured a colour, and at
the battle of Ramillies surrounded and
disarmed the French Regiment du Roi,
capturing no less than <i>seventeen standards</i>.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Fact: <i>vide</i> "Regimental Record."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Our officers were all gentlemen of high
spirit, who belonged to the best families
in Scotland; and so attached were their
men to them, that the corps seemed to be
but one large family.  Punishments&mdash;especially
degradations&mdash;were almost unknown;
yet "auld Geordie Buffcoat," as
they named Preston, was one of the most
strict colonels in the service.
</p>

<p>
Every regiment has its own peculiar
history and traditions, just as a family, a
city or a nation have; these are
inseparably connected with its own honour,
achievements and badges, and with the
military glory of the country, and thus
inspire and foster the fine sentiment of
<i>esprit du corps</i>.
</p>

<p>
But to resume:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
We marched southward by easy stages,
and during the spring of the year were
quartered at Newmarket, where the inns
have ever been proverbial for the excellence
of their stabling and other accommodation,
and where the race-ground and extensive
heath were so admirably adapted for training
the cavalry, who were all subjected to
severe drill in anticipation of foreign
service.
</p>

<p>
By this time I had gone from squad to
squad, rapidly through all the phases
which a recruit has to pass&mdash;position-drill
and sitting up till my spinal column was
erect as a pike; club-exercise to expand
the chest and strengthen the muscles of
the arm.  Then came pacing and marching;
then equitation, embracing all the
skilful and ready aids by which to guide
and control my horse in all his paces, and
to acquire a firm seat in every variety of
movement&mdash;to govern him also by my legs
and bridle hand, so as to leave my right
at the fullest liberty for the use of my
weapons.  Then I had the exercise of the
latter to acquire&mdash;the sword, carbine, and
pistol.  Other hours were devoted to lance,
post, and stick practice.  Even a smattering
of farriery was not omitted; so the first six
months which followed my <i>début</i> as a
Scots Grey left me little leisure for
reflection, or for the study of ought else than
would conduce to make me a perfect
dragoon, skilled in all the science of
destroying human life.  I learned, moreover,
that a <i>perfect</i> dragoon is not made in
a day.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Preston daily superintended in
person the training of his recruits; and
the presence of the fine old man, with his
mingled kindness and enthusiasm, kindled
a kindred spirit even in the breast of the
dullest fellow among us.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to me&mdash;but it might be fancy&mdash;that
he took particular interest in myself,
for he frequently spoke to me with
such words of encouragement or praise,
that my young heart swelled with
gratitude; and I felt certain when the time
came, that I would follow the brave old
man, even to the cannon's mouth, with
the devotion of a son, rather than the
mere obedience of a soldier.
</p>

<p>
An anecdote of our veteran colonel,
then current, related that when George II.,
who frequently displayed much favour
and partiality for the Greys (notwithstanding
his hatred of the Scots), was
reviewing them in Hyde Park one day
before the Marshal Duke de Broglie
and a prince of the House of Bourbon,
Louis Philippe, Duke of Orleans, he
said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Monseigneur le Prince, did you ever
see a finer regiment?"
</p>

<p>
"They are fine indeed," replied the
Prince, as the royal staff passed along the
line; "but pardon me if I think them
inferior to our Gendarmes de la Garde.
Did your majesty ever see <i>them</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"No," replied the king; "but I have
little doubt that my Scots Greys have&mdash;eh,
Colonel Preston?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the Colonel, grimly, "we
<i>have</i> seen them."
</p>

<p>
"Where?" asked Louis Philippe.
</p>

<p>
"At Dettingen, when auld Jamie
Campbell, who was killed at Fontenoy,
led us to the charge against them."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;well," said the king,
impatiently, "and what followed?"
</p>

<p>
"We cut them to pieces, and there I
took their <i>white standard</i>, cleaving the
bearer down to the breeks; and the prince,
if he chooses, may see it now, hanging in
Westminster Hall."
</p>

<p>
At Newmarket my chivalry received a
severe shock, by being present at the
execution of a Light Dragoon who was
shot for desertion.  He had been sentenced
to three hundred lashes by a regimental
court-martial.  On this, he appealed to a
general court, which, instead of confirming
the former sentence, inflicted the penalty
of&mdash;death!
</p>

<p>
It was long before I forgot the horrors
of that scene; the grey light of the early
morning&mdash;our pale faces on parade&mdash;the
ominous silence&mdash;the almost whispered
words of command&mdash;the pallid prisoner,
as he knelt beside his black deal coffin,
and the shriek with which he fell within
it as the death volley rang across the far
extent of the open heath, and then the
trumpet sounding to form open column
and pass the poor corpse by files,
announced that all was over.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
MY HOPE FOR THE FUTURE.
</h3>

<p>
I have stated that I was placed in the
troop of Captain Francis Lindsay, which
for a time separated me from my friends,
Charters and Kirkton.  This was one of
the nine troops of Light Horse, or Hussars,
lately formed, one of which had been added
to every regiment of heavy cavalry.
</p>

<p>
In a speech recently made in Parliament,
His Majesty observed "that the late
success of his ally in Germany had given
a happy turn to his affairs, which it would
be necessary to improve."
</p>

<p>
The loyal Commons took the hint and
liberally granted new supplies, both for
the service of Frederick of Prussia, who
was then at hostilities with the French
monarch, and for enabling the army in
Hanover to co-operate with him vigorously;
and war having two years before
been declared against France, an
expedition&mdash;of which we were to form
part&mdash;was prepared for a descent upon the coast
of that country.
</p>

<p>
We were detached from the regiment,
and ordered from Maidenhead to Southsea
Common, where we were encamped
and brigaded with the light troops of
other dragoon corps, for instruction in
the Prussian exercise; and I may state
without vanity that the light troop of the
Greys in aspect, mount, and discipline,
were allowed by those who saw them far
to excel every other in the camp.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "The <i>flower</i> of the Hussars is the troop
commanded by Captain Lindsay, quartered at
Maidenhead, where they have been practising the
Prussian exercise, and for some days have been
digging large trenches and leaping over them; also
leaping high hedges with broad ditches on the
other side.  Their captain on Saturday last swam
his horse over the Thames and back again, and the
whole troop were yesterday to swim the
river."&mdash;<i>Weekly Journal</i>, May 23, 1758.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Resolved to rise in the service by my
own merit alone, I strained every energy
to become master of my drill in all its
principles and theory.  The sword or foil
was never out of my hand when I could
find an antagonist; thus I became an
expert swordsman, as well as an excellent
horseman, and a decidedly good average
shot with pistol or carbine.  With either,
I would put a bullet through a common
playing card, when passing it on the
ground at full gallop.  This devotion to
my profession, and my rapid progress did
not fail to recommend me to Captain
Lindsay, a brave and high-spirited officer,
to whom we were all devoted.  He was a
handsome fellow too, and generous as a
prince&mdash;to use a common phrase&mdash;especially
when on service, sharing whatever
he possessed with his men.
</p>

<p>
It was while here under canvas, working
hard, drilling, trenching and ditching,
teaching myself and my horse&mdash;a noble
grey, sixteen hands high, and a model of
temper and courage&mdash;to swim when fully
accoutred, that in a tavern near the camp,
an old, tattered, and liquor-stained copy
of the "Weekly Journal" one evening
fell in my way.  Books, periodicals, and
papers were then almost unknown in camp
and barracks, though the gallant General
Wolfe had striven hard to encourage the
formation of regimental libraries, and
since I had donned the red coat, I had
neglected everything connected with
literature, save a French grammar, of which
during my scanty leisure hours, or when
on guard, I laboured hard to make myself
master.
</p>

<p>
While lingering over a pint of beer, I
read every word of the "Journal," even
to the obituary; and in the column of
the latter, was a notice that gave me a
shock, as if struck by a bullet.
</p>

<p>
It recorded the death of my grandfather
four months ago by a sudden
attack of gout in the head, caused, it was
stated, by the grief he experienced on
hearing that his well-beloved heir,
Mr. Anthony Gauntlet, had been killed by a
fall from his horse when riding furiously
near Kirk Yetholm.  "Thus," continued
the paper, "the estates of Netherwood,
worth thirty thousand per annum, pass
to Mr. Anthony's only sister, the
charming Miss Aurora Gauntlet, who becomes
one of the richest heiresses on the Border,
and thus disappears one of our oldest
baronetcies, the first Sir John Gauntlet of
that ilk, having been one of those, <i>infeft</i>
in lands in Canada with power of castle,
pit and gallows, in the usual form, by the
earth and stone of the castle hill of
Edinburgh, and by the hand of Charles I., in
person, in 1633."
</p>

<p>
"Disappears!" I muttered, through
my clenched teeth.  "True, the title
disappears; but only for a time I trust."
</p>

<p>
I sat long buried in thought after this.
Thirty thousand pounds per annum!
That money by right was mine; this
cousin, this Aurora, whom I had never
known, never seen, and whom I hated in
my heart as a fresh usurper, would
doubtless be married by some one&mdash;a
fortune-hunter, a needy adventurer perhaps&mdash;and
thus my patrimony would go to the
enrichment of strangers, while I&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Thick and fast, fierce thoughts
crowded upon me; I had little more
than enough to pay for the poor glass
of beer I had drunk, but I threw it
on the table, and walked sullenly off
without waiting for the change.
</p>

<p>
As I walked along the road, other
emotions came over me&mdash;emotions that
were prouder, better, more lofty and more
soothing, for I saw the white tents of the
camp&mdash;my new home&mdash;shining in the
setting sun, as they dotted all Southsea
Common.
</p>

<p>
I remembered the story of one whose
fate was somewhat, if not exactly,
similar&mdash;the poor Scottish baronet, Sir Robert
Innes, who became a private in the foot
regiment of Colonel Winram, of Liberton,
and remained there long in obscurity, as
private Robert Innes, till a former friend
recognised him when on duty as sentinel
one day before the quarters of the
colonel.
</p>

<p>
On discovering that he was thus
honoured by having a baronet to guard
his door, Winram obtained Innes a
commission, and gave him in marriage his only
daughter and heiress, Margery.  I thought
I would strive to be like him, and until
the lucky spoke of Fortune's wheel turned
upmost, I would relinquish, save in my
secret heart, all pride of birth or position
of family, and the past, and forget too
the important monosyllable, of which
my unnatural grandfather had left nothing
undone to deprive me.  This was a
brilliant bit of romance, no doubt, but
unlike Winram, poor old Colonel Preston
had no inheritance save his sword and his
quaint uniform; and no beautiful daughter
to bestow.  I had no former friends to
recognise me, and bring about a striking
denouement, so I might be sentinel at his
door for a hundred years before he could
befriend me as Sir Robert Innes was
befriended by Colonel Winram.
</p>

<p>
As a supplement to the notice I had
seen, next day on parade the trumpet-major
of the Light Horse, who usually
acted as our postman, handed me a large
thick letter.  It bore the Berwick
postmark, and was addressed in the familiar
handwriting of Mr. Nathan Wylie.
</p>

<p>
My heart sprang to my lips, but I had
only time to thrust the missive into one
of my holsters, for the trumpets sounded
to "fall in" and I was kept in an agony
of suspense and anxiety to learn the
contents&mdash;which seemed rather bulky&mdash;during
the whole of a long and tedious
morning parade, with its subsequent drill
on the common.
</p>

<p>
What could this letter be about, what
its contents?  Money?  It seemed too
hard for bank-notes.  Was it about
Ruth&mdash;poor little Ruth whose soft image now
rose so upbraidingly before me; for sooth
to say, in the hurly-burly of camp and
quarters, I had quite forgotten her.
</p>

<p>
The moment parade and drill were over,
I rushed away to a quiet nook, and tore
the packet open.  It contained a letter
from Nathan Wylie, short, dry, and
professional, together with an old parchment,
snuff-coloured by time.
</p>

<p>
It briefly stated that in his last will
and testament, my respected grandfather
had cut me off with the sum of one shilling
sterling, which the writer herein inclosed,
together with a document which he sent,
doubtless as a taunt upon my private's
uniform&mdash;the diploma of the Netherwood
baronetcy.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
THE FRENCH DESERTERS.
</h3>

<p>
Lord Anson, Vice-Admiral of the Red,
having put to sea with seventeen sail of
the line (one of these was the hapless <i>Royal
George</i>, which afterwards sunk in Portsmouth
harbour), and several frigates, with
some smaller craft, to block up Brest, and
favour the descent to be made on the
French coast, our expedition was prepared
with great rapidity, and Charles Spencer,
Earl of Sunderland, who had lately
succeeded to the Dukedom of Marlborough,
arrived in camp, to take command of the
troops.
</p>

<p>
Our recent successes by land and sea,
the territories and victories won by our
armies in America, the East and West
Indies; the almost daily processions
through the streets of London, escorting
Spanish treasure to the Tower or to the
Mint, accompanied by the captured
ensigns of French and Spanish admirals,
gradually filled all Britain with a fiery
enthusiasm, and fanned the passion of
glory in the usually phlegmatic breast of
John Bull to such a degree, that nothing
now was talked of but war and conquest,
and the strange resolution was come to of
carrying hostilities into the heart of
France!
</p>

<p>
There were mustered on South sea
Common, sixteen regiments of the line,
nine troops of Light Horse (ours included)
six thousand marines, and three companies
of artillery, the whole under the Duke of
Marlborough, with Lieutenant-Generals
Lord George Sackville, and William, Earl
of Ancrum, K.T., with four Major-Generals,
Dury, Mostyn, Waldegrave, and Elliot,
the future Lord Heathfield, and "Hero of
Gibraltar," who led the Light Horse, six
hundred in number.
</p>

<p>
The noble harbour of Portsmouth, which
is so deep and so sheltered by high land
that the largest ships of the line may
there ride out the roughest storm without
touching the ground even at the lowest
ebb of the tide, presented a scene of
unusual bustle and preparation.
</p>

<p>
It was crowded by craft of every
description; ships of the line, frigates,
gun-brigs, tenders, store-ships, and
transports; its waters being literally alive
with man-of-war boats, barges, and
launches, skimming to and fro, filled
with seamen and marines, or laden with
stores, water-casks, and ammunition which
were being conveyed from the town or
arsenals to the fleet.
</p>

<p>
Twelve flat-bottomed boats, each capable
of holding sixty-three men, were prepared.
These were to be rowed by twelve oars
each, and were not to draw more than
two feet of water.  Meanwhile a vast
number of scaling ladders, sandbags to
form batteries, baskets for fascines,
waggons for the conveyance of wounded,
of stores and plunder, had been brought
to Portsmouth from the Tower.
</p>

<p>
Several launches and many bridges,
each sixty yards in length, together with
floats and stages, for landing the troops,
horses, and horse artillery, were made in
all haste.
</p>

<p>
Nothing was omitted that might ensure
the success of this daring expedition, for
which the departure of Lord Alison's fleet
to Brest was certain to open the way, as
we had long since swept the fleet of
France from the seas; and so great was
the enthusiasm in London, that Viscount
Downe, Sir John Armytage, Sir James
Lowther, and many other English gentlemen
of distinction joined the fleet and
army to serve as private volunteers.
</p>

<p>
And there, amid that bustling scene in
Portsmouth harbour, lay the <i>Monarque</i>,
on the quarter-deck of which, the brave
Admiral Byng had been judicially murdered,
in the preceding year, not as his
sentence had it, "for an error in judgment,"
but to cloak the errors of a ministry!
</p>

<p>
The infantry destined to serve on our
expedition, were three battalions of the Foot
Guards; the Eighth, or king's regiment;
the famous Twentieth, or Kingsley's;
the Welsh Fusileers; the Edinburgh
regiment; the Twenty-fourth; Thirtieth;
Thirty-third; Thirty-fourth; Thirty-sixth,
Sixty-eighth, and the regiments of
Richmond and Talbot.
</p>

<p>
From Southsea Common the whole force
was ordered to the Isle of Wight, where
for a short time a camp was formed; but
on the same night that the order for this
movement was issued, I was despatched
on duty to London, bearer of a letter from
Commodore Howe to the Lords of the
Admiralty.
</p>

<p>
I knew not what its contents were
then, but departed on my mission with
the document in my sabretasche, my
orders being simply to deliver it at the
Admiralty office, and to bring back the
answer without a moment of delay.  I
shall now proceed to relate how I was
personally concerned in the contents of
the document entrusted to me for delivery.
</p>

<p>
From the day I joined the army, I was
full of eagerness to bring myself
prominently before my leaders; but my first
essay was singularly unfortunate in its
sequel.
</p>

<p>
One evening when on duty as sentry
on foot with my carbine, posted near some
sea-stores that were piled on the beach,
not far from Southsea Castle, I observed
two men of a foreign and somewhat
suspicious aspect, who were loitering near,
and observing with unmistakeable interest
the shipping in the harbour, the distant
camp on the common, and the stores that
were piled near the castle-gate.  On
perceiving that I observed them they came
directly up to me, and touched their hats
with great politeness.
</p>

<p>
"Mon camarade," said one, in very
good French, "we are French sailors&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then you have no business to be
loitering here," said I, bluntly and
hastily.
</p>

<p>
"Pardonnez-moi, camarade; but we
cannot help it."
</p>

<p>
"Then you are prisoners of war?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay&mdash;&mdash;" stammered the other.
</p>

<p>
"What then?"
</p>

<p>
"Deserters," was the candid response.
</p>

<p>
"You are very rash to be here at such a
time."
</p>

<p>
"We have escaped from the castle of
St. Malo, where we were shamefully
treated, and are anxious to offer our
services and our knowledge of the coast."
</p>

<p>
"To us?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oui&mdash;mon brave,</i>" said the fellow, with
a grimace.
</p>

<p>
"Against your own country?"
</p>

<p>
"Sacre! our country deserves nothing
better at our hands," he continued, smiling
and bowing.
</p>

<p>
My disgust was so strong that I felt
tempted to club my carbine and knock
the traitor down: but I restrained the
emotion and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I am only a private dragoon, and can
in no way assist you&mdash;so please to move
off.  It is contrary to orders for me to
converse thus, and for you to loiter here."
</p>

<p>
"We are aware of that," said one, in a
deep, growling voice, who had not yet
spoken; "but monsieur will perhaps direct
us to whom we can apply."
</p>

<p>
"If you have been in the French
Marine service, you should know that
well enough yourself."
</p>

<p>
I paused, and then thinking that,
though these men were traitors and
rascals, their services or information might
be valuable to the general and commodore,
I said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Messieurs, I may be able to assist
you, when relieved from guard.  What
are your names?"
</p>

<p>
"Mine is Theophile Damien," said the
first speaker.
</p>

<p>
"And mine, Benoit Bossoit."
</p>

<p>
"We have both been seamen, and have
served on board the privateer ship, <i>le
Maréchal Duc de Belleisle</i>, under the
famous M. Thurot, in that battle off the
Firth of Forth, with your two frigates, the
<i>Solebay</i> and <i>Dolphin</i>, in May last."
</p>

<p>
Next day, when relieved from guard, I
met those men, by appointment, at a quiet
tavern, where we had some wine, for
which they paid liberally, seeming to be
very well furnished (especially for
deserters) with Louis d'ors; and in the
course of conversation I spoke freely&mdash;far
too freely&mdash;of the number, strength,
and probable objects of our expedition.
</p>

<p>
The name of one of these men&mdash;a
tall, muscular, dark, and coarse-looking
fellow, whose subdued manner belied his
savage aspect&mdash;struck me as being
singular.
</p>

<p>
"You are named Damien, are you
not?" I said to him.
</p>

<p>
"Theophile Damien&mdash;at monsieur's
service."
</p>

<p>
"It seems familiar to me."
</p>

<p>
"As to the most of Europe," said he,
bitterly, and he ground his strong white
teeth as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"What causes your hatred to your
country&mdash;this disloyalty to your king?"
</p>

<p>
"Tudieu! have I not told you that we
were slaves&mdash;galley slaves&mdash;and confined
in St. Malo?"
</p>

<p>
(I find myself in honourable company,
thought I.)
</p>

<p>
"Slaves without a crime," growled Bossoit.
</p>

<p>
"At least I had no crime," said the
other, "save that I bore the hated name
of Damien."
</p>

<p>
"What," I exclaimed, as a sudden light
broke upon me; "are you a kinsman of&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly, monsieur, of Robert Francis
Damien, you would say&mdash;of that unfortunate
peasant of Tieuloy, who, in January
last year, stabbed King Louis, just as he
was stepping into his state coach at
Versailles, and so nearly rid France of a
tyrant&mdash;yes, I am his brother."
</p>

<p>
"Was not this would-be regicide
deranged?" said I, as fresh doubts of the
value of such a pilot occurred to me, and
I feared for my own honour, if found in
company with Frenchmen of such a
character, and especially at such a conjecture.
</p>

<p>
"His reason was wavering&mdash;poverty
and the long wanderings of an unsettled
life had made it so; but instead of
confining him in a prison or fortress, he died
of the most dreadful tortures," replied the
first Frenchman.
</p>

<p>
"So I have heard."
</p>

<p>
"The king's wound was slight; but
my brother was beaten to the earth by
the sword hilt of Guillaume de Boisguiller,
a captain of the French Guards, several
of whom in the first transports of their
zeal and fury, burned him severely with
their torches, while he lay prostrate at
their feet.  A fortnight after this he was
tried and tortured.  Shall I tell you what
followed?  <i>Tête Dieu!</i> my blood boils,
and my heart sickens at the memory of
it.  After making the <i>amende honorable</i>
in the Church of Notre Dame, he was
conveyed to the Place de Grove, where
vast multitudes were assembled; where
every window was filled with eager faces&mdash;and
every housetop bore a living freight.
</p>

<p>
"The Provost of the merchants, the
Echevins and other magistrates of Paris,
in their robes, with all the great lords and
ladies of the court, occupied the windows
of the gloomy Maison aux Piliers, or Hotel
de Ville, on the spire and pavilions of
which banners waved as for a festival.
In the square, beyond the scaffold and the
troops who circled it, scarcely was there
breathing space, so closely, so densely were
the spectators massed; but a silence like
that of death hushed every tongue, for they
knew that a scene of horror was about to
ensue."
</p>

<p>
The Frenchman paused; the perspiration
stood in bead-drops on his brow; his
face was deadly pale, and I could not fail
to feel deeply interested, while thinking
at the same time, that the language and
bearing of himself and his companion
were very different from what one might
expect to find in a couple of runaway
privateersmen.
</p>

<p>
"If, on that terrible day," he resumed,
"voices were heard, it was the murmur of
those at a distance&mdash;those who were
too far off to see&mdash;the thousands who
crowded the narrow vistas of the Rue
de la Tannerie, the Rue de la
Mortellarie, the Rue du Mouton, and the
Quai de la Grêve, for all Paris had
flocked to witness my brother's execution.
</p>

<p>
"At five o'clock, just as the grey light
of a dull March morning stole over the
pale-faced multitude, the punishment
began.  My brother's right hand was half
consumed by fire, and then struck off.
Amid the agony, though his limb shrivelled
and blood burst forth, <i>O mon Dieu!</i> the
poor soul neither winced nor asked for
mercy; but when pincers, red hot and
glowing, and ladles filled with boiling oil,
molten lead and flaming resin, were
applied to his arms, thighs, and breast, he
uttered shrieks so piercing that every
heart grew sick and every face grew
pale.  On his bones the very flesh was
broiled, and his blood hissed in steam
around him!  He was then disembowelled."
</p>

<p>
"Assuredly that must have put a
period to his sufferings?" said I, in a
low voice.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;the principle of life was strong
within him, for my poor brother was one
of the most athletic of our peasants in
Artois.  These agonies&mdash;this butchery
were insufficient to glut the rage of the
courtiers and the fury of his judges.  Four
strong young horses were now harnessed
to his four limbs, and lashed in opposite
directions, but failed to sever his mangled
frame, and he had now ceased to cry or
moan."
</p>

<p>
"Failed, say you?" I exclaimed,
becoming more and more interested, in spite
of myself, by the Frenchman's detail of
this revolting execution.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;so the chief executioner, with
a sharp knife, severed the sinews at the
joints of the arms and thighs.  Anew, the
long whips were cracked&mdash;again the horses
strained upon their traces, and a leg and
arm were torn from the body of my
brother, who looked&mdash;mother of mercy!&mdash;yes,
looked after them, as they were dragged
along the pavement, with the blood
spirting from vein and artery; but on the
severance of the other two limbs, he
expired.
</p>

<p>
"His remains were then cast into a
fire, which was kept burning all day, and
all the succeeding night."
</p>

<p>
"Were you present at this horrible
scene?" I asked, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;I was with Monsieur de Thurot,
cruising off the coast of Scotland.  On
my return to France, I found my brother's
family and name, even to the most remote
degree, proscribed, and the cottage in
which we were all born, at Tieuloy, in
Artois, razed to its very foundations in
token of infamy, and the place where it
stood had been salted and sown with grass.
On hearing of all this, some bitter words
escaped me, so I was placed in the castle
of St. Malo.  There I made a vow to
achieve both freedom and revenge.  I have
fulfilled the first part of that vow, and,
<i>Dieu-merci</i>!  I am here."
</p>

<p>
A peculiar glance, the meaning of which
at that time I could not understand,
passed between the speaker and his
companion; and as the story of the
former seemed a strange one, I conducted
them at once to Captain Lindsay of our
troop.
</p>

<p>
He questioned them in a manner that
displayed considerable contempt for the
new character they wished to assume;
and then sent them with a note to
Commodore Howe, who at once accepted their
services, and it was with a dispatch
containing some real or pretended information
they had given, that I was sent to
London, on the evening when the troops
began to move for the Isle of Wight; and
I departed, happy in heart and high in
spirit, furnished with an order to the
constables of parishes and others, to furnish
me with such relays of horses as I might
require.
</p>

<p>
Four days' pay were given to me in
advance; but as I left the camp, Captain
Lindsay generously and kindly put a
half-guinea in my hand, and desired me
to "make myself comfortable, and for
the honour of the corps, to avoid all
scrapes and doubtful company by the way."

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
WANDSWORTH COMMON.
</h3>

<p>
It was a lovely May evening when I left
busy Portsmouth.  The shadows of the
tossing branches of the old limes and
sycamores that bordered the wayside were
cast far across the yellow corn; the white
and purple lilacs, the golden laburnum
trees, and the tall hollyhocks with their
gorgeous crimson flowers, made beautiful
the gravelled avenues that led to many a
villa and farm, while the fertile uplands
that sloped in distance far away, were
half hidden in the warm haze of the
summer sunset.
</p>

<p>
I felt proud of my showy uniform,
proud of my beautiful grey charger, and
proud of the mission on which I was
departing, though in the humble capacity of
an orderly dragoon; and I was happy in the
prospect of two days of perfect freedom
from the routine and trammels of the
camp, for a soldier, however young and
enthusiastic, soon learns that he is no
longer "the lord of his own proper person."
</p>

<p>
My chain bridle and steel scabbard
jangled in unison to the clank of my
horse's hoofs, as he trotted rapidly along
the level highway, and in my young heart
swelled anew all the pride of being a
soldier, a horseman, and an armed one.
</p>

<p>
Within a week I should probably be
treading the soil of hostile France, even
as I was then treading the soil of
peaceful and happy England.  France! might
I ever return from thence?  Many of us
were fated there to find our last home,
and might I not be one of the doomed?
I thrust aside the thought&mdash;not that I
feared death, I was too young and too
hopeful for that; but shrunk from the
idea of perishing with the mass, before
I had achieved what I conceived to be
my mission; before I had won myself
a right to bear with honour the name my
forefathers had bequeathed to me, and
before I had resumed that title, the
diploma of which the miserable Nathan
Wylie had sent in mockery to the private
soldier!
</p>

<p>
Night came on and the road grew dark
and lonely; there was no light save that
of the stars, which I saw reflected at times
in the bosom of the Wye, and twelve
tolled from the steeples of St. Mary and
St. Nicholas, as I entered the quaint old
market town of Guildford, and rode
straight to the Red Lion, where I stabled
my horse and ordered a relay for the
morrow.
</p>

<p>
A forty miles' ride gave me a good
appetite; I supped and retired to bed,
where I slept without a dream even of the
future, for I was weary.
</p>

<p>
The next day was far advanced before I
set forth again; but I proceeded slower
now, the hack furnished to me by the
innkeeper proving very different in mettle
from my fine grey charger.  In short, the
animal nearly broke down by the way,
and though the distance between Guildford
and the metropolis is only about
thirty miles, evening closed in before I
saw at a distance the vast and dusky
dome of St. Paul's, rising in sombre
grandeur from amid the yellow haze,
formed by the smoke and by the myriad
lights of London.
</p>

<p>
I had left behind me the little village
of Wandsworth, which is finely situated
on the declivities of two small hills, and
was traversing the common, then a wild
and open waste covered with grass, gorse,
and tall waving weeds through which the
roadway passed.  Clouds had now obscured
the stars, and the night was so dark that
I had some difficulty in tracing my path,
though the accumulated glare of the innumerable
street lamps and other lights of the
vast city was very distinct but a few miles
off, rendering the foreground darker.
</p>

<p>
When about the middle of the common,
I heard the sharp report of a pistol and then
the scream of a woman.  These alarming
sounds, and the flash of the explosion, came
from the very path I had to traverse, so I
spurred on my jaded hack, and found a
carriage stopped on the common by two
armed and mounted highwaymen, with
crape masks on their faces.  Such gentry
were at that period still in the zenith of
their perilous fame.
</p>

<p>
They had fired a shot to make the
postillion pull up, and were now stationed
one at each window of the carriage,
demanding the purses and other valuables
of the travellers.
</p>

<p>
My holster pistols were at the demi-pique
saddle of my troop horse, which I
had left at Guildford; so drawing my
sword, I rode boldly up and demanded
what was the matter, and who fired the
shot I had heard.
</p>

<p>
"You had better ride on and attend to
your own affairs," replied a surly fellow,
with a horrible oath, as he coolly reloaded
his pistol.
</p>

<p>
"Surrender your weapon, rascal," I
exclaimed, resolutely, "or I shall cut you
to the teeth!"
</p>

<p>
"Fire at him, Bill," cried he to his
comrade.  "Zounds! are we both to be
cowed by a saucy shoulder-knot?"
</p>

<p>
On hearing this, his comrade urged his
horse furiously round from the other side
of the carriage.  Then I heard another
female shriek as he levelled a bright-barrelled
blunderbuss, the bell-muzzle of
which was so near my face that the light
flashed on it as he drew the trigger, for
happily it only burned priming; otherwise
my head would have been blown to
atoms, as on inspection afterwards I found
this formidable firearm was loaded with
slugs of lead and iron.
</p>

<p>
"Hung fire, by all that's infernal!"
exclaimed the fellow; but his exclamation
of wrath ended in a howl of agony, when
by a stroke of my sword I hewed off half
of his right hand, and the weapon fell on
the road, together with three of his
fingers.  On this they put spurs to their
horses and galloped away at a break-neck
pace.
</p>

<p>
With a shout of victory I pursued them
for a few hundred yards across the
common, and then returned at a canter
to the carriage, the occupants of which
proved to be two ladies, who, by their
manner and difference of years, appeared
to be mother and daughter.  They had
with them a waiting-maid, and it was she
whose cries I had twice heard.
</p>

<p>
Their air was distinguished; the
younger was a very beautiful girl with
fair hair and a delicate complexion, but
this was all I could discern by the light
of a carriage lamp, which one of the
footmen&mdash;a rascal who had hitherto hidden
himself among some fern&mdash;now held
within the window, while the ladies were
putting on their rings, gloves, and
bracelets which they had drawn off to
surrender at the moment I came so luckily to
their rescue.
</p>

<p>
"Mamma, dear mamma, all danger is
past.  They are gone, and we are safe;
be assured, be satisfied," I heard the soft
voice of the younger say imploringly to
the elder, who was excessively agitated.
</p>

<p>
"Ladies," said I, touching my cap, "be
composed now, I pray you; those fellows
have fled, and are not likely to return.
Fortunately, I have put a mark upon one
that he will not easily efface."
</p>

<p>
"Sir," replied the elder lady, in a voice
still tremulous with alarm, "accept our
deepest gratitude.  To you we owe our
rescue.  Our money and jewels would
have been a trifling loss, but how know
we that these men might not have murdered
us here on this lonely heath? and
we hear of such dreadful things in these days."
</p>

<p>
"But was your servant here without
pistols?"
</p>

<p>
"No, a pair of loaded horse-pistols are
always in the rumble with John," replied
the young lady.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you not use them, fellow?"
said I, turning sharply to the valet.
</p>

<p>
He reddened and stammered something
about the danger or rashness of one man
encountering two, but his knees were
trembling under him, and the hand which
held the carriage lamp shook as if with
palsy.  In fact, he seemed so convulsed
with fear that the young lady and I
could not forbear laughing at him.
</p>

<p>
"When passing this way again, I shall
take care to travel by daylight, or with a
bolder escort than you, John Trot," said
she, while the maid-servant, whose face I
had not yet seen, as she sat in a dark
corner, loudly and bitterly expressed her
contempt for the unfortunate knight of
the shoulder-knot, and for his lack of
valour.
</p>

<p>
"We left the residence of a friend near
Croydon about sunset, and should have
been in London long since," observed her
mother, "but a wheel came off at the
cross road which leads to Kingston, and
thus we were detained until this unpleasant
hour.  Have you, sir, also come from
Croydon?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, madam, I have just come from
Portsmouth."
</p>

<p>
"Portsmouth!" echoed both ladies,
with voices expressive of interest and
animation.
</p>

<p>
"With despatches from Commodore
Howe for the Lords of the Admiralty,"
said I, with an emotion of vanity
difficult to repress, especially at my age
then.
</p>

<p>
"Are you one of those who are bound
for France?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madam."
</p>

<p>
"When does the fleet sail with the
army?"
</p>

<p>
"Next week, 'tis said; but nothing
definite has yet transpired," I replied,
with all the air of a staff officer.
</p>

<p>
"Poor boy!" I heard her say, with
something like a sigh, and with winning
softness of tone, as the valiant John
Trot asked if the carriage was to move
on.
</p>

<p>
"As the night has become so dark,
madam," said I, "you must allow me
to have the honour of escorting you to
town.  You have still to pass Clapham
Common, and its reputation for safety is
somewhat indifferent.  Even in Lambeth
I have heard that robberies have been
frequent of late."
</p>

<p>
"But how can we trespass so far upon
your kindness, sir?" urged the young
lady, whose voice made my heart beat
faster.
</p>

<p>
"Believe me, madam, I deem it a great
honour and happiness to have been of
service to you, and for to-night, at least,
your way shall be mine.  I am pretty well
mounted, and very well armed."
</p>

<p>
"Fortunately, you are also proceeding
to London," said her mother; "therefore
I accept your polite offer with gratitude."
</p>

<p>
I bowed nearly to my horse's mane, and
then said to the valet&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hand up that blunderbuss, John; it
may serve as a trophy, and remind your
lady of to-night's engagement on
Wandsworth Common."
</p>

<p>
"And the three fingers&mdash;oh&mdash;ugh?"
asked John, with chattering teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Those you may pocket, if you please,"
said I, while withdrawing the charge,
which, as I have said, proved to be slugs.
I put the weapon in the rumble, and then
the carriage was driven off.
</p>

<p>
As it rolled over the dark heath, I rode
at a quick trot behind it; but frequently,
when our pace became slower as we
ascended a slope and the horses walked,
the ladies conversed with me, and then I
rode abreast of the open windows.
</p>

<p>
It was evident that by being muffled in
my trooper's cloak, and having on a small
foraging cap, I was taken for an officer;
thus the elder lady gave me her card, and
expressed, in the usual polite terms, the
delight it would afford them to see me at
their residence in some modish square
(I failed to catch the name), if I had leisure
to-morrow morning, as they had to leave
town again at mid-day.
</p>

<p>
I felt piqued, and an emotion somewhat
of bitterness and mortification stole into
my heart; and while secretly cursing alike
the rules of society and my own false
position, I thanked her for the kind
invitation, but without the least intention
of availing myself of it.  After this, I
became a little reserved; but it was a
difficult task to be so with the young lady,
who was a lovely girl, and lively too.  She
conversed with me gaily, and asked if I
longed for foreign service; if I thought
the war would be protracted; if we were
sure to beat the French; if I was not
afraid&mdash;she begged pardon for such a silly
question&mdash;of being shot in battle; and a
hundred other pretty nothings, while her
sweet face and sparkling eyes seemed to
come out of the gloom of the travelling
carriage, and then to fade into it
again, as we passed an occasional dim
street-lamp, all of which in those
by-gone days I need scarcely say were lighted
by oil.
</p>

<p>
At the bridge of Westminster, which
had been built about ten years before, I
bade them adieu, and with something like
a sigh of regret, departed in search of
some humble hostelry wherein to pass the
night.
</p>

<p>
This brief meeting&mdash;the whole episode
in all its details interested me deeply.
Those women so highly bred, so delicately
nurtured, so richly dressed, so gentle and
winning in manner, were so different from
those whom I was now compelled to meet,
in camp and barracks, at the canteen and
sutler's tent, that for the first time my
heart repined at the prospect before me.
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!" said I, "let me think of
this no more."  But near a lamp I reined
up to examine the lady's card, and searched
my pockets in vain.  I had lost it!
</p>

<p>
"It matters little," thought I; "and
yet, withal, I should like to have known
their names."  And amid the roar and
bustle of the lighted streets of London,
I still seemed to hear the merry laugh and
gentle voice of the fair-haired girl whose
hand I had so recently held in mine.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
THE RACE.
</h3>

<p>
All the adventures of the preceding night
appeared but a dream, when early next
morning&mdash;at least so early as I could hope
to find any high officials at their
office&mdash;I rode through the crowded streets of
London, and delivered the despatch of
Commodore Howe at the Admiralty.
</p>

<p>
"Immediate" being written on the
envelope, I had to remain in a waiting-room
for more than an hour, after which
the answer was entrusted to me, addressed,
"On H.M. Service," to Commodore Howe.
As I afterwards learned from the public
prints, this document, among other
instructions, empowered him to avail himself
of "the services and information of the
two French deserters named on the
margin&mdash;Theophile Damien and Benoit
Bossoit."
</p>

<p>
I consigned it to my sabretasche,
remounted, and quitted London at a quick
pace about two p.m.
</p>

<p>
On leaving the greater thoroughfares
behind, when traversing the suburbs I
easily lost my way, and at a tavern, near
which a number of fellows in their shirtsleeves
were playing skittles, I drew up to
inquire the way to Portsmouth.
</p>

<p>
I questioned one who was seated at the
door smoking; he was a man with a very
sullen and forbidding expression of face,
who had his left hand thrust into the
breast of his vest.  He wore a shabby
snuff-coloured suit with large steel buttons;
his legs were incased in long riding-boots
spotted with mud, and I perceived the
brass butts of a pair of pistols, peeping
from his square flapped side pockets.
</p>

<p>
I was somewhat surprised when this
sinister-looking stranger, after giving me
a long and ferocious stare, started from
his seat, uttered a deep imprecation, and
entered the house.  I then called to the
skittle players, and repeated my question
to them.
</p>

<p>
On this they simultaneously abandoned
their game, and gathered about me.
</p>

<p>
"The Portsmouth road lies straight
before you," said one; "be you going to
France, my lad?"
</p>

<p>
On my replying in the affirmative, they
gave a simultaneous cheer, and, amid cries
of "Old England for ever!" and "Down
with the Johnny Crapauds!"  I had to drink
with them all, and they continued to wave
their hats as long as I was in sight, while
galloping along the road they had indicated.
</p>

<p>
Being anxious to reach Portsmouth and
to rejoin, I rode at a hard trot; the road
was good, the country open and level.
Two mounted persons appeared at times
behind me; but I continued to keep in
advance of them.  Some association of
ideas made me think of the sulky fellow
I had seen at the tavern door, and of the
two highwaymen of the preceding night;
but after a time I perceived that one of
the riders was a lady, and that both were
coming along at a rasping pace, as if
determined not to be distanced and left
behind by me.
</p>

<p>
I had taken the Epsom road, thus a ten
miles' ride brought me to Ewell, near
which, in a pleasant green lane, where the
plum and apple trees that bordered the
way intertwined their branches
overhead&mdash;one of those quiet, dewy, and shady
green lanes that are so peculiarly English,
where the bees hum, and the gossamer
webs are spun&mdash;I drew bridle to breathe
my horse.
</p>

<p>
I now heard the sound of hoofs coming
rapidly along the road, and in a minute
after, there swept past me the fair traveller
I had seen, and some yards behind her
rode a man in livery.  They were both
admirably mounted on blood horses.  Her
ample skirt, her long fair hair, and the
ostrich plume in her hat streamed behind
her.  I could see with a glance that she
had her horse well in hand, though it flew
almost at racing speed, causing mine to
rear and strain upon the bit, as she passed
me with a merry ringing laugh of delight,
and with a flourish of her whip, so much
as to say, "A challenge&mdash;we have
distanced you at last!"
</p>

<p>
This I was not slow in understanding,
and feeling somewhat piqued, put spurs to
my nag, and dashed off in pursuit by the
highway that led to Epsom.
</p>

<p>
Twice I saw her looking back, which
her valet, though a good horseman, scarcely
dared to do; and each time she plied her
little riding-switch with no very sparing
hand, and like a girl of spirit.
</p>

<p>
Copsewood in full foliage, thatched
cottages half buried among ivy, hops and
flowers, ripe corn fields, and red brick
houses, seemed to fly past, and in a very
short space we found ourselves traversing
Banstead Downs.  I gained on them fast,
for my horse had been thoroughly breathed.
I soon passed the livery servant, and a
few more bounds brought me neck and
neck with his mistress, who turned to me
laughingly, a flush&mdash;the genuine flush of
youth, pleasure, and exercise glowing in
her soft cheek&mdash;and simultaneously we
pulled in our horses on recognising each
other.
</p>

<p>
She was the charming blonde I had met
on Wandsworth Common&mdash;the heroine of
my last night's adventure!
</p>

<p>
My cavalry cloak was rolled and strapped
to my saddlebow; and I thought there
could be no mistaking my private's uniform
now, and indeed, her countenance changed
very perceptibly as she said,
half breathlessly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, my friend.  So I have
actually been running away from the
person to whose courage mamma and I
owe so much!"
</p>

<p>
"It would almost seem so," said I,
bowing.
</p>

<p>
"Believe me, sir, I knew not that it
was you," she resumed, colouring deeply,
and casting down her eyes (how fair her
soft loveliness looked by day!).  "I saw
but a horseman before me, and could
not resist the temptation of passing him."
</p>

<p>
"Nor could I resist the desire of
accepting your very palpable challenge," I
replied, just as the valet came up, fearfully
blown, and in his crimsoned face I recognised
the features of the valiant Mr. John
Trot.
</p>

<p>
"But I was not altogether trying a race
with you," said the young lady, still
blushing deeply, and beginning to move
her horse away; "I was riding fast to
overtake mamma, who is in yonder
carriage.  She is come to drink the waters
of Ashted Spa, and I doubt not will be
glad to tender you once again her thanks."
</p>

<p>
With these words, and with an air that
seemed to say, "This interview, or this
mistake, has lasted long enough," she bowed
and urged her horse towards the carriage,
which was standing about fifty paces
distant on the high road, and from a window
of which I saw a lady observing us.
</p>

<p>
The young girl's figure showed to
perfection on horseback, and her
riding-habit, which was of light green cloth,
trimmed with narrow gold braid, suited
well her blonde beauty and golden-coloured
hair.  She wore a broad black beaver hat,
from which a single ostrich feather drooped
gracefully on her left shoulder.  Loosened
by the roughness of the gallop, her
soft hair flowed over her neck in silky
ripples&mdash;I know no more fitting term&mdash;of
light golden brown, that glittered in
the sunshine.  Her riding-gauntlets were
of yellow leather, and her hands, as they
grasped the reins and riding-switch,
seemed small, compact, and beautifully
formed.
</p>

<p>
"I thought we had lost you, madcap!"
said her mamma, with annoyance in her
tone and manner; "what caused you to
gallop thus along the Downs, as if riding
a race?"
</p>

<p>
"I was running something very like it,
certainly, mamma; but do you not see
that we have been overtaken by&mdash;the&mdash;the
gentleman who saved us from robbery
last night?"
</p>

<p>
"I am hastening back to Portsmouth,
madam," said I, with a profound salute.
"In my ignorance of the country I have
taken the road to Epsom instead of that
which leads to Cobham, and to this
mistake I owe the good fortune of meeting
with you again."
</p>

<p>
"You had not time, probably, to visit
us before leaving town this morning?"
said she.
</p>

<p>
"I had the mischance, madam, to lose
your card."
</p>

<p>
At that moment, a man of sinister
aspect, and shabbily attired, but with
holsters at his saddle, looked fixedly at us,
as he rode slowly past, on a bald-faced bay
horse.
</p>

<p>
His <i>left</i> hand was bound up by a red
handkerchief, and, consequently, he held
the reins of his bridle with the <i>right</i>.  He
glared at me, with a glance of such
undisguised ferocity, that I had not a doubt
he was the wounded rascal of last night's
adventure&mdash;the same man, he of the
snuff-coloured suit and steel buttons, whom I
had seen with the skittle players in the
suburbs of London.
</p>

<p>
Was he dogging me?
</p>

<p>
If so, 'twere well to be prepared.  All
this flashed upon my mind with the usual
rapidity of thought; but I was too much
interested by my new friends to attend
to him then, and, ere our interview was
over, he had disappeared upon the way
to Guildford&mdash;the road <i>I was to pursue</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Zounds!  I must look out," thought
I, "or there may be a blank in Lindsay's
muster-roll to-morrow."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
THE HANDKERCHIEF.
</h3>

<p>
"It is, indeed, singular that we should
meet again, and so soon, too!" said the
elder lady, who, notwithstanding the
silver tinge amid her auburn hair, still
bore unmistakable traces of a beautiful
person; "your regiment is, I think, a
Horse Grenadier one?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madam."
</p>

<p>
"The Guards?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;it is the Scots Greys, or Second
Dragoons&mdash;yet we boast ourselves 'Second
to None.'"
</p>

<p>
"A proud vaunt," said she, smiling at
my manner.
</p>

<p>
She was silent for a few moments,
during which I was conscious that her
daughter was observing me with some
interest.  As our officers did not then
wear epaulettes, but simply a silver
aiguilette, her next observation was an
awkward one for me.
</p>

<p>
"You are a captain, I hope?" said she,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Nay&mdash;I am too young," I replied,
with a hesitating manner and a glowing
cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Yet Wolfe, whom I once knew, was
a colonel at twenty.  Then you are a
cornet?"
</p>

<p>
I felt the blood rushing to my temples&mdash;yet
wherefore should I have blushed
"for honest poverty?"
</p>

<p>
"Curiosity is the privilege of our sex,"
said the young lady, coming to my
rescue; "thus mamma is most anxious
to know to whose bravery we owed our
safety."
</p>

<p>
"Madam, I have not the honour to be
more than a private trooper," said I, with
a bearing of pride that had something
stern in it.
</p>

<p>
Mamma did not lose her presence of
mind, though the colour in her daughter's
cheeks grew deeper, but replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"All, indeed!  I believed you by your
bearing to be an officer."  She drew her
head within the carriage.
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, madam; I was not
always what I am to-day," said I, sadly.
</p>

<p>
"And now, my good fellow, if you will
favour me with your name, Colonel Preston
shall be duly informed, by letter, of your
courage."
</p>

<p>
There was another pause, during which
I shortened my reins, and was turning
my horse, when the winning voice of her
daughter, which had a singularly sweet
chord in it, arrested me, as she said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You belong, you state, to the Greys?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know a soldier named
Gauntlet&mdash;Basil Gauntlet?"
</p>

<p>
It was now <i>my</i> turn to feel confusion
and extreme surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but how has he the honour, the
happiness to be known to you?" I
inquired, with growing astonishment, while
gazing into her clear, bright eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I have an interest&mdash;have we not <i>both</i>
an interest in him, mamma?" said she,
with confusion.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;in a poor unfriended trooper?"
I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"He is from our neighbourhood&mdash;that
is all," replied the young lady, with a
hesitating manner.
</p>

<p>
I scanned her face in vain; its soft
expression and lovely features, her hair of
golden-brown, her eyes of dark blue-grey&mdash;eyes
full of faith, of truth and merriment
withal, were quite unknown to
me, and my heart beat quicker while
my bewilderment increased, as she said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"We have heard that this ill-starred
lad has become wild, rakish, bad,
incorrigible and ugly."
</p>

<p>
"Ugly?  Come, I am sorry you say
so," said I, with something of pique.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked the mamma, raising her
eyebrows and eyeglass.
</p>

<p>
"Gauntlet and I are alike as twin
brothers could be, and I don't like to hear
him reviled."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, indeed," said she, glancing at me
leisurely through her eyeglass.  Then, as
thoughts of Jack Charters' countess, and
the scrape <i>she</i> had lured him into occurred
to me, I resolved to become reserved; but
could not help inquiring&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Permit me, ladies, to ask how poor
Gauntlet is so fortunate as to interest
you?"
</p>

<p>
"We are namesakes&mdash;that is all,"
replied the elder lady, rather coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Namesakes!" echoed I; but at that
moment, as the arms on the panel of the
carriage door caught my eye&mdash;a shield
<i>argent</i> charged with a gauntlet <i>gules</i>&mdash;a
new light broke upon me.  Anger&mdash;sudden,
fierce, and glowing anger&mdash;was
my next impulse, and, turning to the fair
rider, I stammered, but my voice almost
failed me, "You are&mdash;you are&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The granddaughter of Sir Basil
Gauntlet, of Netherwood," said she, with
haughty surprise.
</p>

<p>
I was silenced and confounded!  This
lovely girl whom I had twice met so
singularly and so abruptly, was my cousin
Aurora, the new usurper of my patrimony&mdash;one
whom I had schooled myself to
hate and in my soul revile; and this elder
lady, so noble, so courtly, and still so
handsome, was the mother of my late
fox-hunting cousin Tony&mdash;my aunt by
marriage&mdash;she who doubtless believed me
to be&mdash;if she ever thought of me at all&mdash;the
outcast, runaway, and worthless wretch
my unnatural grandfather had sought to
make me.
</p>

<p>
Pride and a just sense of indignation
swelled up within me, and I sat on my
horse, silent, irresolute, and stern.  Aurora
and her mother knew little of the stormy,
the fierce conflict of nameless emotions
that raged in my heart.
</p>

<p>
"Adieu, soldier," said the mamma,
"with a thousand thanks for the service
so bravely and politely rendered.  If you
will not give us your name, at least do me
the favour of accepting this," she added,
drawing forth her&mdash;-purse.
</p>

<p>
I uttered a scornful laugh, and reining
back my horse, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay, ladies, though impoverished
and humbled, I cannot submit quietly to
the degradation of being offered money."
</p>

<p>
"This is most singular!"
</p>

<p>
"How is mamma to reward you?"
asked the young lady, with something of
surprise and, as I thought, pleasure in her
tone.  It might be that I flattered myself.
</p>

<p>
"By permitting you to give, and me to
accept&mdash;" said I, taking a lace handkerchief
from her hand, for I was always a lover
of effect, and resolved to produce one
now&mdash;"of this trifle as a remembrance&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of what?" she asked, blushing to the
temples; "a remembrance of what?"
</p>

<p>
"That Basil Gauntlet has been of some
service to Aurora, the beautiful cousin who
has done him a grievous wrong in
unwittingly depriving him of his heritage
and birthright.  Three days, now, may
find me on the seas for France; so adieu,
aunt and cousin, adieu for evermore!"
</p>

<p>
Then I cut short this remarkable
interview by spurring my horse with such
energy that he made a wild bound, and
sprang away at a dashing pace along the
road to Guildford.
</p>

<p>
Impulse had made me take Aurora's
handkerchief, and impulse now made me
regret having done so.
</p>

<p>
Pride resumed its sway, and thus, while
riding furiously along the road, I never
turned once to look behind me.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
THE RED LION AT GUILDFORD.
</h3>

<p>
As I rode on, anger, pride, a keen sense
of the foul injustice with which my family
had treated me, and of the false position
in which they had placed me with the
world, prompted me with a desire to cast
Aurora's handkerchief to the wind; but
the knowledge that she was an unwitting
participator in the act by which my
grandfather had transferred my heritage to her
late brother, Tony; the memory of her
kind manner, the gentle expression of her
eye; together with certain high-flown
ideas I had gathered from novels, tales
of chivalry, and other romantic lore,
prompted me to retain it.  Edged with
lace, it was of the finest cambric, and
"Aurora," marked by her own hand, no
doubt, appeared on one of its corners.
</p>

<p>
It was strange, but certainly not
unpleasing, that she should think of and ask
for me, whom she had never seen; and
the tones of her winning voice yet lingered
in my ear.  My mind soared into airy
regions, and became filled with tumultuous
and undefined thoughts, for I was a famous
architect of castles in the air.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that I had the lamp of Aladdin,
or even his ring, for ten minutes!" I
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
Aurora&mdash;who was well named so, with
her pure complexion and golden hair&mdash;was
the only living relative who had ever
bestowed a thought upon me, so I placed
the relic of her in my breast, and rode on,
little foreseeing that on a future day that
handkerchief would prove the means of
saving my life.
</p>

<p>
On reaching Guildford, I repaired at
once to the inn, where, on entering the
stable, I remember well how my noble
grey welcomed me by neighing, by licking
my hand, and rubbing his forehead against
me, when I greeted him as an old friend.
</p>

<p>
In the next stall there was a bald-faced
nag with eyes askance, surveying us over
the trevice boards, and his aspect seemed
familiar to me.
</p>

<p>
The Red Lion at Guildford was one of
those huge, misshapen, queer old galleried
houses which still survive the Tudor days
in many parts of England.  It had acute
wooden gables, with stacks of clustered
chimneys that started up in picturesque
confusion.  The walls were plastered and
whitewashed, and had varnished beams of
ancient oak, in some instances richly and
grotesquely carved, placed in them
horizontally, perpendicularly, and diagonally.
On the side which faced the stable-yard
there opened a triple row of bedroom
galleries, having twisted balustrades; and
all this quaint superstructure rose from
an arcade composed of octagonal stone
pillars and ponderous beams of good old
English oak elaborately carved.  Gigs,
chaises, covered carts, and red four-wheeled
waggons, occupied the sheds around the
yard; and the sound of hoofs and the
rattle of stall collars evinced that the
stables were well filled.
</p>

<p>
When I arrived night was closing in,
and a bright red light streamed cheerily
through the windows of the bar into the
outer darkness as I entered by the porch,
which had a flight of steps down, instead
of up to the door, for so old was the
edifice that the soil had gradually
accumulated far above its original basement.
</p>

<p>
I am thus particular in describing the
house, in consequence of a startling
incident which occurred during the few hours
I sojourned there.
</p>

<p>
I inquired of the ostler to whom the
bald-faced nag belonged, and he replied
to a gentleman who had retired to bed,
weary with a long journey.
</p>

<p>
The host of the Red Lion was so
patriotic that he insisted upon having me
to sup with him, and he would make no
charge for my own or horse's entertainment.
He drank deeply, and anon was
soon borne away to bed by the ostler and
waiter, while shouting vociferously,
"Britons, strike home!" and "Down with
the Johnny Crapauds!"
</p>

<p>
After this, I retired immediately, being
anxious to reflect a little over the passages
of the day, to sleep, and if possible to
depart by daybreak.
</p>

<p>
As the waiter, candle in hand, was
conducting me along one of the bedroom
galleries, which I have described as
overlooking the stable-yard, a dark figure
appeared to hover at the further end; and
there from amid the shadow a human
face seemed to peer out as if observing us.
</p>

<p>
The hour was late, and the place in all its
features strange to me.  I stepped towards
this eavesdropper, but he or she
immediately disappeared.
</p>

<p>
If ghosts there were in Guildford, the
upper regions of the quaint old
tumble-down Red Lion seemed to be the very
place in which one might take up its
quarters, but other thoughts than of
ghosts were in my head, so I inquired
where the rider, or proprietor of the
bald-faced nag was located.
</p>

<p>
"In number six," replied the waiter.
</p>

<p>
"On this gallery?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"And mine?"
</p>

<p>
"Is number twelve&mdash;the oak room.  His
is at yonder end."
</p>

<p>
"'Twas there the figure disappeared."
</p>

<p>
"Figure?  Well, there ain't no ghosts
or ghostesses either in the Red Lion that
ever I heard of, and I have been here both
man and boy these many years."
</p>

<p>
"How is this traveller dressed?" I continued.
</p>

<p>
"In brown broadcloth, I think, master."
</p>

<p>
"With a rusty old cocked hat?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, bound with black galloon."
</p>

<p>
"Is his left hand wounded?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't know," replied the waiter,
yawning, "for he keeps it always in his
weskit pocket."
</p>

<p>
My suspicions now amounted to
certainty.  He was my acquaintance of
Wandsworth Common&mdash;the highwayman,
beyond a doubt.  We were certainly in
too close proximity, but the landlord of
the inn was too tipsy to be referred to, and
I had no desire to be detained upon the
morrow, charged as I was with important
papers for the commodore at Portsmouth,
thus I made no more remarks, but took
the candle, entered my room, and shut the
door.
</p>

<p>
The apartment was entirely pannelled
with dark wainscot, hence its aspect was
quaint and gloomy; the furniture was
uncomfortably antique, for this being one
of the upper and cheaper lodgings of the
Red Lion, the whole appurtenances were
the oldest in the house, having gradually
retired from story to story, till their last
service was to be spent in the attics.
</p>

<p>
The fireplace was wide, lined with blue
Dutch tiles, and had a little old-fashioned
basket grate, set upon square blocks of
stone.
</p>

<p>
From the latticed window I could see
the Wye winding under the bridge, the
dark arches of which were clearly reflected
in its starlit current beneath.
</p>

<p>
Two strong bolts secured my door, so
there was no danger of being surprised by
my friend in the snuff-coloured suit
through that avenue.  I threw off my
belts and uniform, and slipped into a bed
that felt cold, damp, and old, for the
moths flew out of the russet-coloured
canopy and hangings, to flutter about the
candle end, the light of which expired
just at the moment when I had no further
use for it.
</p>

<p>
I felt feverish, wakeful, and full of
many thoughts.  Then there were strange
sounds in this old house rather calculated
to banish sleep; the night wind moaned
in the wide chimneys: rats scampered
about behind the decaying wainscot,
scattering fragments of lime in their career.
It might be fancy, but twice some one
seemed to lift the latch of my door softly
as if attempting to open it.
</p>

<p>
Ere sleep began to weigh my eyelids
down, I had mentally rehearsed over and
over again the two unexpected interviews
with my cousin Aurora; and again I
repented having condescended to take her
handkerchief even in a spirit of gallantry.
</p>

<p>
It was very cavalier-like no doubt&mdash;very
romantic and all that; but in my
heart I linked her and her mother with
those who had outraged and wronged me,
and pride dictated that I should have left
them in ignorance of who I was, and then
have ridden off on my lonely way.
However, now the deed was done, and regret
was unavailing.
</p>

<p>
Would they&mdash;Aurora and her stately
mother&mdash;triumph over the temporary,
alas! it might be permanent, obscurity
and humility of my position?  There are
human hearts wicked enough to feel such
triumph, for many persons hate those
whom they wrong; but Aurora's gentle
voice and tone of sympathy when addressing
me removed the supposition that she
could be guilty of this.
</p>

<p>
I had met with so little kindness in
the world that the circumstance of her
remembering even my existence impressed
me deeply.
</p>

<p>
These two interviews dwelt long in my
memory.  I was now excluded from the
society of polished and educated women:
indeed, from the force of that evil destiny
to which I had been abandoned, I had
hitherto seen little of either; thus the
charm of my cousin's manner and the
beauty of her person filled my heart with
new aspirations, and a keener desire to
assume my place in society; but at present
the die was cast, and to France must
I go as a private dragoon.
</p>

<p>
My half-drowsy ruminations had been
frequently disturbed by sounds too strange
to escape my observation.  At last they
impelled me to sit up in bed, to listen and
to look around me.
</p>

<p>
The room was dark as a tomb, save
where through the fantastic iron tracery of
the antique window I could see the clouds,
like masses of black crape, float past the
twinkling stars.
</p>

<p>
On the wind, which came down the
old chimney, there were borne sounds
like sobs and sighs&mdash;like fierce mutterings
and groans that became deep, hollow, and
agonizing; and they seemed to be emitted
from the wall immediately above the
fireplace.
</p>

<p>
My ears tingled and drops of perspiration
started to my forehead, for I must
confess that, at the moment, I was weak
enough to fear the supernatural, until
there came the decidedly earthly sound of
a huge piece of plaster falling heavily into
the empty grate.
</p>

<p>
After a time the noises entirely ceased
and I was about to drop asleep, when a
hoarse and despairing cry, as of some one
being strangled close to my bed, rang
through the panelled chamber, and
brought me again to a sitting position,
with all my pulses quickened to the
utmost by apprehension and the vague
sense of sudden alarm.
</p>

<p>
"This can no longer be borne!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
Starting from bed I drew my sword,
and unbolting my door issued forth into
the gallery which overlooked the stable-yard.
</p>

<p>
The night, or rather the morning-air,
was mild and balmy; the wind had died
away, and all was calm and still.  I heard
the clock of the Guildhall strike the hour
of two.  No other sound stirred the air;
and as noises at that still hour are so
deceptive&mdash;though there was something
in that hoarse cry which impressed me
with horror&mdash;a dread of ridicule, or of
being the victim of some piece of waggery,
prevented me from summoning the
domestics of the inn; so once more I
bolted the door, put my sword at the
head of the bed, and therein ensconcing
myself, soon fell sound asleep.
</p>

<p>
The next day was rather far advanced
when I woke up and started from bed, on
instantly remembering that I must be gone
without delay.
</p>

<p>
During a hasty breakfast I could not
refrain from speaking to the landlord of
the noises which had disturbed me so
much in my chamber.
</p>

<p>
"Was the wind high or stormy last
night?" I began.
</p>

<p>
"No; the weather was rather calm," said
he, with his mouth full, for he was making
a hearty, old-fashioned breakfast of sliced
beef, and nut-brown, home-brewed ale.
</p>

<p>
"Were any persons quarrelling or fighting
hereabout?"
</p>

<p>
"When?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, all night; till two in the
morning at least."
</p>

<p>
"I heard not a sound&mdash;the house was
perfectly quiet."  This statement the
waiter, ostler, and landlady hastened to
corroborate.
</p>

<p>
"Then," said I, "by Jove your inn is
haunted."
</p>

<p>
"Take care what you say, my good
fellow," replied the landlord, becoming
angry; "for lookee, my house has as good
a reputation as any in the county of
Surrey, so none of your tricks, soldier."
</p>

<p>
"Then the devil was in my chimney
all last night, say what you will," I
responded with equal, if not greater,
irritation.
</p>

<p>
On hearing this the landlord's colour
changed visibly.  He went immediately
to my room, accompanied by a servant,
who soon returned making a great outcry,
and stating that a man had been found
wedged in the chimney, that by looking
up with a lighted candle, his heels could
be seen dangling some five feet or more
above the mantelpiece.
</p>

<p>
On hearing these tidings, the whole
household became excited, and crowded
to the apartment I had so lately quitted.
</p>

<p>
On looking up I could see, amid the
obscurity of the chimney, the feet of a
man, but they were beyond our reach.
Workmen were soon procured; the
panelling was removed; then the bricks
were taken out, a breach made, and in
something less than an hour, the dead
body of a man was exhumed, all begrimed
and covered with soot and lime.
</p>

<p>
He had evidently died of suffocation,
having reached a portion of the chimney
where he could neither descend further
nor work his way up again, and had there
miserably perished; being literally choked
by the soot and lime, of which he had
inhaled such quantities in his fruitless
struggles and painful gaspings, that his
foam-covered mouth and bloodshot eyes
were quite filled with them.
</p>

<p>
His left hand was found to have been
recently mutilated; his right still grasped
a sharp clasp knife, which was doubtless
intended for <i>my</i> behoof, as an examination
proved the body to be that of the traveller
who had occupied No. 6, in the upper
gallery&mdash;the figure I had detected,
watching in the gloom, when retiring to rest.
</p>

<p>
As some housebreaking implements
were found in his pocket, the landlord
averred that he had been in search of the
strong-box and plate-room; but I had my
own idea of his too probable errand, and
thus the terrible sounds which had so long
disturbed me, and that last hoarse cry of
despair and death, were completely
accounted for.
</p>

<p>
Fearing that I might be detained until
a coroner's inquest had been held,
concerning the death of this highwayman and
would-be assassin, while all the inn people,
guests, and servants, were fall of dismay
by the discovery, I saddled my grey, and
set forth for my destination at a spanking
pace which soon left Guildford far behind.
</p>

<p>
Before the evening gun had boomed
from Southsea Castle I had reached
Portsmouth, delivered my despatches and
reported myself at head-quarters.
</p>

<p>
I was heartily welcomed by Charters
and Kirkton, who had been sent by
Colonel Preston to join Lindsay's light
troop.  I rejoiced at this, having sorely
missed their society and companionship.
</p>

<p>
My few hours of freedom and romance&mdash;for
there was something of romance in
Aurora possessing my fortune, and I only
her handkerchief&mdash;were now at an end,
and again I was simply Basil Gauntlet the
private dragoon.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
SAIL FOR FRANCE.
</h3>

<p>
By the last day of May, all the troops
destined for the hostile expedition were
embarked on board of the ships of war
and transports.  In all there were thirteen
thousand fighting men, with sixty pieces
of cannon, and fifty mortars.
</p>

<p>
The embarkation of our horses was
an object of peculiar care, and General
Elliot, with Captain Lindsay, of ours,
superintended this duty in person&mdash;for on
the manner in which it is performed,
depends all the chance of cavalry being
employed with success in the field after
landing.
</p>

<p>
They were conveyed on board the
various ships, after a short march of
exercise, and when perfectly <i>cool</i>.  On the
first night after embarkation, each received
a mash mixed with some nitre, and bran
was supplied to every trooper, as the chief
portion of his horse's daily ration.
</p>

<p>
Every day each dragoon had to wash
with care the hoofs and fetlocks of his
horse, and to sponge its face, eyes and
nostrils with cold water.  We had ample
wind sails rigged up for air, and spare
slings and bands all ready in case of
illness or accident, but, fortunately, neither
occurred among the nags of our troop at
least.
</p>

<p>
At daybreak, on the first of June, a
gun from the commodore gave the signal
<i>for sea</i>; and in less than ten minutes every
vessel had her anchor apeak or atrip, and
her head sails filled, and soon after, with
nine hearty cheers, the whole armament,
consisting of twenty-four ships of war, and
one hundred and forty transports, cutters
and tenders, stood out into the channel,
and a glorious sight they presented.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Essex</i>, a sixty-four gun-ship,
commanded by our commodore, the Honourable
Richard (afterwards Earl) Howe, led
the van, and closely in her wake followed
the <i>Brilliant</i> of thirty-six guns, commanded
by Captain Hyde Parker, who was afterwards
knighted for his services off the
coast of America.
</p>

<p>
As the <i>Essex</i> bore across Sandown Bay,
I have been told that the French deserter,
Theophile Damien, assisted with his own
hands to steer the ship, as if in token
of the good service he meant to perform
for us in future.
</p>

<p>
There was a pretty stiff breeze on this
morning, and I had a dread of sea
sickness, as the vessel rolled heavily, her
main-deck being encumbered by stores;
but the novelty of the scene and of the
situation, together with the activity of
the seamen, as they swarmed up aloft and
lay out upon the yards, occupied all my
attention for a time; and to our tars of
after years, the Jacks of Anson and of
Howe, in their little low cocked hats,
Dutch-cut pea-jackets, petticoat trousers,
and brass-buckled shoes, would present a
very unusual spectacle.  Certainly their
costume was scarcely fitted for sending
down the topgallant yards, or lying out
on the man-rope to close-reef topsails in
a gale of wind; but they were true tars,
nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
Ere long the breeze, which had
favoured us so much that the shores of
England had lessened astern, veered
somewhat ahead; the weather became stormy
and wet, and I was glad to keep below,
and share the stall of my horse.  While
Kirkton, Charters, and others, who had
been frequently at sea before, sat out upon
the booms to leeward, and smoked to fill
up the time.
</p>

<p>
In their mirth and cheerfulness, they
formed a contrast to the unfortunate
seasick troopers, who were all huddled away
in groups, seeking shelter under the lee of
anything that offered itself, and who
remained there in discomfort and misery,
till the drum beat for all but the watch to
go below and turn in.
</p>

<p>
Next day I came on deck about dawn,
and joined Charters, who was one of the
morning watch, and here I may mention,
that when on boardship, troops are divided
into three watches, and must take their
share of all deck duty with the seamen.
A subaltern officer has charge of each
watch, and there are also, when the
numbers embarked will permit it, a captain
and subaltern of the day.
</p>

<p>
"Gauntlet, my lad, you look pale,"
said Charters, as he trod to and fro to
keep himself warm; for though the month
was June, the air upon the morning sea
was cold, and the chill spray came flying
in showers over the weather cat-heads, as
the <i>Brilliant</i> sped upon her course, like
all the fleet which covered the open
channel, close hauled; "the morning watch is
a devilish cold one, and we have no chance
here of getting a hair of the dog&mdash;eh?"
added my friend, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"What land is that?" I asked, with
chattering teeth, while clutching the
rigging with one hand, and pointing
southward with the other.
</p>

<p>
"The land of France&mdash;that is Cape
La Hogue," replied Charters.
</p>

<p>
"Ay," growled an old quartermaster;
"yonder is the fort, with the flag flying."
</p>

<p>
The old tar's eyes must have been
better than mine, which could discern
neither fort nor flag; but I muffled my
trooper's cloak about me, and set myself
to watch the hostile shore.
</p>

<p>
The outline of the land looked dim and
low, and like a dark cloud, as it rose from
the grey morning sea, which was all of a
dusky tint and flecked with masses of
foam.  The whole aspect of the fleet was
gloomy and cheerless now; the decks and
canvas were wet and dripping with the
rain of the past night, and with the spray
of the waves, for there was a heavy sea
running in the channel; but anon the sun
began to rise through successive bars or
streaks of purple and saffron cloud; then
the long lines of waves rolled after each
other glittering in light.  The canvas
aloft became whiter; the hulls of the
vessels shone and became instinct with
life, as the red port lids were triced up,
the snowy hammocks placed in their
nettings, and the scarlet coats crowded on
the decks; drums and bugles were heard
from time to time, warnings for parade,
orders or messing, as the swift fleet flew
on at the rate of eight knots per hour,
and now and then, by a signal from the
commodore, the best sailers were ordered
to cast a tow-line to the more slow,
especially our deeply laden storeships.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the 3rd of June we
came to anchor, between Sark and Jersey,
for what reason I know not.  In the night
we had a hurricane; one transport lost a
mast, another lost her bowsprit, and a
third, crowded with foot soldiers, was totally
lost by running foul of a sunken rock.
The boats of the <i>Brilliant</i> were piped away
with great celerity, and all the troops
were saved before the wreck went to pieces;
but I shall never forget that horrible
night&mdash;the darkness of the atmosphere,
the bellowing of the wind and the roaring
of the sea, while the frigate leaped,
plunged and strained on her cables, like a
restive horse; and then, amid all this, the
danger and excitement caused by the
sinking of the transport amid the obscurity
of that stormy midnight sea, and the loss
of life that might have ensued but for the
skill and bravery of our seamen.
</p>

<p>
Jersey is so surrounded by reefs of
sunken rock, that it was a miracle no
more of our armament perished on this
occasion.
</p>

<p>
On the morning of the 5th, the
commodore signalled to weigh anchor and
pursue our course.
</p>

<p>
The whole fleet ran with a fair breeze
along the coast of Normandy, and so close
were we in shore, that the houses, farms,
and even the inhabitants could be seen
distinctly without the aid of glasses.  At
one place we saw a column of French
Infantry on the march, with all their
bayonets glittering in the sunshine; at
another, where the land opened near
Sainte Soule, a regiment of dragoons
riding at full gallop in the direction we
were pursuing.
</p>

<p>
"Tom, we shall be under fire to-morrow,"
said Charters, thoughtfully, as he knocked
the ashes from his pipe into the palm of
his left hand and scattered them to leeward.
</p>

<p>
"All the better," replied Kirkton, "the
see-saw of home service has sickened me."
</p>

<p>
"And me too," added I, "and I long
for some keen excitement."
</p>

<p>
"Excitement," replied Charters, "then
you are likely to have it with a vengeance,
my boy!  Think of thirteen thousand men
invading France!"
</p>

<p>
By two o'clock p.m. we came to anchor
in Cancalle Bay, on the coast of Brittany,
nine miles eastward of St. Malo.  The
<i>Brilliant</i> lay not far from the famous rock
of Cancalle, so celebrated for its oysters,
the fishing of which forms one of the chief
sources of local wealth.
</p>

<p>
Commodore Howe, it would appear, had
now questioned narrowly the two French
deserters, Theophile Damien and Benoit
Bossoit, whom I had been the humble
means of introducing to his notice, and
discovering that they were profoundly
ignorant of the whole locality, he began
to suspect both their veracity and
intentions, and therefore ordered them to be
made close prisoners, while, accompanied
by the Duke of Marlborough, Colonel
Watson our quarter-master-general, and
Thierry the pilot, he went in the <i>Grace</i>,
an armed cutter, to reconnoitre the Bay.
</p>

<p>
The information of two pretended
deserters, as to the position and strength
of batteries, and so forth, having proved
perfectly erroneous, on his return the
commodore ordered the Frenchmen to be
searched; and then, on papers detailing
the number and object of our armament
being found upon them both, he forthwith
ordered them to be put to death in the
most summary manner.
</p>

<p>
Posted as sentinel on the poop of the
<i>Brilliant</i>, I was in ignorance of all this, and
was treading to and fro carbine in hand,
with my eyes fixed on the rough and wooded
shore of Brittany, when Captain Lindsay
came on deck, harnessed in full regimentals
with sword and gorget on.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Gauntlet," said he, "your two
Frenchmen have, unfortunately, proved to
be impostors and spies, after all."
</p>

<p>
"Spies!" I reiterated, with some dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; of the most dangerous kind."
</p>

<p>
"And what is to be done with them, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"That which the laws of war direct&mdash;ah! look yonder!"
</p>

<p>
He pointed to the <i>Essex</i>, the ship of
the commodore, and a thrill of horror ran
through me, on beholding two human
forms run up simultaneously by the neck,
to the arms of the foreyard, where they
dangled for a minute in mid-air; but they
were not meant to be hanged, as each had
a cold thirty-two pound shot at his
heels.
</p>

<p>
This must have been a pleasant
spectacle for Thierry the pilot, who was
also a Frenchman, and consequently a
traitor.
</p>

<p>
A gun was fired from the bow of the
<i>Essex</i>; solemnly the echoes of the sea
and shore replied, and ere the last had died
away, both culprits had vanished under
the waves, whose ripples closed over them
and left no trace behind.  Then, as the
pale and fierce dark face of Damien came
in memory before me, I turned to my
leader and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Captain Lindsay, the fate of Damien
forms a terrible sequel to the story of his
brother."
</p>

<p>
"That story was falsehood&mdash;all," replied
the captain; "he was no relation whatever
of the famous would-be regicide, who was
a peasant of Artois.  The name of the
spy was Theophile Hautois, not Damiens,
and he never was a privateersman, nor
served under Thurot, but was a forester of
Brittany, and, as some suppose, a robber
among the Menez Mountains.  His whole
narrative, so far as he was concerned,
proves an artful forgery, and, like his
companion, he was a fully accredited spy
of the French authorities, employed to
obtain information which his lips can never
render them now."
</p>

<p>
The boom of a second cannon now
pealed across the Bay.
</p>

<p>
"The commodore has fired another gun
and hoisted a signal," said an officer
close by.
</p>

<p>
The signal midshipman raised his
telescope to the bunting which we saw
fluttering at the mainmast-head of the
<i>Essex</i>.
</p>

<p>
"What is it now&mdash;what says the order?"
asked several, with the impatience and
curiosity natural enough at such a time.
</p>

<p>
"All ships having flat-bottomed boats
and landing-stages, <i>to hoist them out</i>!"
replied the middy, with a kindling eye.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo," added Captain Lindsay;
"that seems like work!  Ere long we
shall have to look to our spurleathers and
spatterdashes."

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
THE LANDING AT CANCALLE.
</h3>

<p>
It was very singular that though our
armament had been visible off the coasts
of Normandy and Brittany for four days,
no preparations were made anywhere to
oppose us.  A strong French fleet lay in
the harbour of Brest, but was there blocked
up by the squadrons of Lord Anson and
Sir E. Hawke, so it might as well have
been in the Yellow Sea.
</p>

<p>
Just as the commodore's last signal
concerning the boats was hoisted, two
troops of French cavalry, and a regiment
of infantry, appeared on the heights above
the Bay of Cancalle, where we saw their
appointments and weapons glittering; but
after a time they fell back and disappeared
inland.
</p>

<p>
The flat-bottomed boats were soon
launched, and the grenadier companies of
eleven regiments rendezvoused on board
of them, around the <i>Essex</i>, the
headquarter ship.
</p>

<p>
The commodore now shifted his broad
pennant on board the <i>Success</i>, a frigate of
twenty-two guns, which got under weigh,
and stood close inshore to silence a battery
of only <i>three</i> guns, which had begun to fire
across the bay.
</p>

<p>
These were the first hostile shots I had
heard; and I must own that they caused
my pulses to quicken, and created an
undefined anxiety in my heart; yet I had
already stood fire, when so narrowly
escaping Abraham Clod's gun on the roof
of old Wylie's stable, and that adventure
made me smile when I thought of it
then.
</p>

<p>
Those three cannons&mdash;two 24's and one
12-pounder&mdash;were all we had as yet to
oppose, and they were in position at the
landing-place of the fisher-town or village
of Cancalle, which consisted of a group
of picturesque little houses, situated at
the base of a green hill that overhangs
the sea.
</p>

<p>
The French cannoniers who handled
them were brave fellows, for they killed
several men on board the <i>Success</i>, nor were
they silenced, and the beach swept of the
inhabitants, till the commodore's ship,
together with the <i>Rose</i>, <i>Flamborough</i>, and
<i>Diligence</i>, opened their broadsides to the
land, and filled the whole bay with smoke,
making every rock and mountain echo to
the reverberations of a cannonade that
lasted till seven in the evening, for we had
a dread of masked batteries among the
shrubberies and hedgerows near the shore.
</p>

<p>
Under cover of this fire, the flat-bottomed
boats, with three battalions of
the Guards, and eleven grenadier
companies of the Line, commanded by Lord
George Sackville (son of Lionel, Duke of
Dorset) and General Dury, rowed inwards,
and landed on the beach in safety.
</p>

<p>
Those ships which contained the cavalry
and artillery were now ordered to draw
closer inshore.  Our horses were slung
over into the flat-bottomed boats alongside&mdash;each
trooper, fully accoutred, standing
in the wooden stall by his charger's head.
It was about eleven at night before the
light troop of the Greys, in four large flat
barges, put off for the harbour, towards
which we were slowly towed by the boats
of the <i>Brilliant</i>.
</p>

<p>
The night was a lovely one.  High
sailed the moon in heaven, with clouds
of fleecy whiteness flying past her silver
disc.  The beach and the blue sea were
light as if at noonday, and on the far
expanse of yellow sand, in that secluded
cove, where the aged oak and lime trees
spread their summer foliage on the
ripples&mdash;sand so soft, so smooth and golden that
one could only think of nymphs or fairies
disporting in fantastic dances there&mdash;we
were disembarking Horse, Foot, and
Artillery, with loaded arms and lighted
matches, in all the grim array of war.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the huge boats, with their freight
of Cavalry crept inshore.  Streaming
from behind the dark mountains, the
moonlight fell in long and tremulous
lines of silver sheen, in which our weapons
and the trappings of man and horse
glittered gaily, and the whole scene was
picturesque and impressive.
</p>

<p>
Each after each, the lights that whilome
twinkled in the little town went out, as
we supposed the people were taking to
flight, and soon obscurity veiled it all,
save where one or two tapers seemed to
indicate a sick room, or a student's
vigil&mdash;if, indeed, at such a time, one could be
philosopher enough to study.
</p>

<p>
Our Foot, already formed in quarter
distance columns, after their colours were
uncased, their flints and priming inspected,
were silent and still; thus, save the
occasional neigh of our horses, as they
snuffed the land, with necks outstretched
and nostrils quivering, there was no sound
along the bay, but the murmur of the
rising tide, when it chafed on the steep
Rock of Cancalle.
</p>

<p>
Beside me stood Jack Charters, tall,
erect, and soldier like.  One hand grasped
his horse's bridle, the other rested in the
steel basket hilt of his long broad sword.
With a keen, bright eye, and a proud smile
on his lip, he was looking at the shore,
where&mdash;like myself&mdash;he hoped to regain
by bravery and courage the position he
had lost by his own youthful folly and
the injustice of others.
</p>

<p>
At last we were alongside the rough
pier of Cancalle, and some of Kingsley's
Grenadiers, who were ordered to assist in
getting the Cavalry and Artillery
disembarked, ran the landing stages on board
for our horses.  The first of ours, on <i>terra
firma</i>, mounted, and sword in hand,
was our gallant leader, Captain Frank
Lindsay.
</p>

<p>
"Quick, my lads&mdash;get on shore and
join the captain," said Charters, who,
although a corporal now, could not forget
the authority he had once wielded; "he
is a man to stand by, for true it is that
a good officer to lead makes a good soldier
to follow."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay," added Kirkton, as he, too,
leaped joyously into his saddle, and made
his horse curvet, while he sung:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Tis he, you, or I,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold, hot, wet, or dry,<br />
  We're always bound to follow, boys,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scorn to fly."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Fall in, my lads&mdash;fall in as you come
ashore&mdash;and take up your dressing by the
standard," cried Captain Lindsay.
</p>

<p>
A seaman, a good-natured fellow, was
assisting me with my horse across the
landing stage, when there was a whizzing
sound, and a shot that came, no one knew
from where, shattered his right elbow.
He uttered a groan, and would have fallen
between the boat and pier, had not
Sergeant Duff, of the Greys, caught him in
his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, mates," said he, cheerfully;
"tie up the stump, some one&mdash;I'm
in for a pension at Chatham Chest, boys!"
</p>

<p>
I remember that my first emotion was
a selfish thankfulness that the shot had
not struck <i>me</i>.
</p>

<p>
So strong was the ground by nature,
in the neighbourhood of our landing, that
two thousand determined men might have
cut to pieces ten times their number from
behind the thick hedgerows, the houses
and the rocks; yet we encountered not
the slightest opposition, save from the
little battery already mentioned.
</p>

<p>
By the noon of the 6th of July, everything
belonging to our small army&mdash;its
whole material of war&mdash;was ashore, and
we encamped on an eminence which was
crowned by a picturesque old windmill.
</p>

<p>
It overlooked Cancalle, from whence
the people&mdash;all hard-featured, ungainly,
and squalid-looking Bretons&mdash;had now
entirely fled, leaving their houses to the
mercy of our soldiers and sailors, who
pillaged them of everything they could
find or destroy.
</p>

<p>
On the night of the 6th, with twenty
other Scots Greys, I was detailed for
out-picket; and under a Captain Wilmot
Brook, of the 11th Light Dragoons, with
twenty men of that regiment, all supplied
with one meal of cooked food for ourselves
and forage for our horses, we rode two
miles to the front, on the road that leads
from Cancalle to St. Malo.  There the
captain chose a position for his picket,
and threw out a line of videttes, whose
orders were to keep a sharp look-out, on
peril of their lives; to fire their carbines
on the approach of any armed party, but
to permit all persons who came singly,
bearing provisions for sale, to pass to their
rear, without exacting a fee for their
passage&mdash;to observe well the country in
their front, and to communicate whatever
they saw that seemed hostile or suspicious,
by signal or otherwise, to each other, and
at once to the officer in command of the
outpost.
</p>

<p>
These orders were rhymed rapidly over
to me about nightfall, and I was left for a
two hours' vigil, in a gloomy hollow way
between two hills, about eight hundred
yards in front of the mainbody of the
picket.  This was my <i>first</i> responsible
duty, and it so nearly ended in bringing
me to a disgraceful and violent death,
that the narration of that night's
adventure deserves a chapter to itself.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
THE VIDETTE.
</h3>

<p>
To a young soldier few duties or situations
are more trying than the post of advanced
sentinel by night, in a strange place and
foreign country, in time of war and
danger&mdash;all the more so, perhaps, if the said
soldier be a Scotsman, imbued with some
of those superstitions, which few of his
countrymen are without.
</p>

<p>
"Keep your ears and eyes open, young
man," said Captain Brook as he left me.
"Remember that you are not now a sentry
at the gate of a home-barrack, which no
one thinks of attacking, but that you are
an advanced vidette, on whose vigilance
and acuteness depend the safety of the
picket, the honour of the army, and hence,
perhaps, of the nation itself."
</p>

<p>
"Does he deem me stupid, or what?"
thought I, with some pique, as he rode
off, accompanied by Sergeant Duff of ours,
and I was left alone&mdash;alone to my own
reflections.
</p>

<p>
The moon which shone so brightly last
night was now hidden by masses of cloud,
yet a few stray beams lighted the
landscape at a distance.  In the immediate
foreground, and around me, all was sunk
in darkness and obscurity; but after my
eyes became accustomed to the gloom, I
could make out the form of the two
rugged eminences or hills which
overhung my post, and the pathway that
wound from thence into the defile between
them.
</p>

<p>
Beyond that defile I could see the
distant country, lighted at times, as I
have said, by the fitful gleams of the
moon.
</p>

<p>
All was still and I heard only the
champing of my horse upon his powerful
military bit, as I sat with the butt of my
carbine planted on my right thigh, gazing
steadily at the darkened pass in my front.
</p>

<p>
The time passed slowly.
</p>

<p>
Twice I threw the reins across my left
arm, and twice cocked and levelled my
carbine, for on each occasion figures
seemed to enter the pass, some on
horseback and others on foot; but the next
moment showed them to be only fashioned
by my overheated fancy, out of the long
weeds and nettles that waved to and fro
on the night wind between me and the
faint moonlight beyond.
</p>

<p>
On each of these occasions I made a
narrow escape; to have fired my carbine
would have drawn the whole line of
pickets to the front, and brought the
entire army under arms; but then to give
a <i>false</i> alarm is a crime to be punished,
though not quite so severely as to omit
an alarm when necessary; so my position
was sufficiently perplexing.
</p>

<p>
Silence, night, and loneliness induced
reverie, and from the present and from
the future, memory carried me back to
the past&mdash;that period which possessed so
little that was bright for me.
</p>

<p>
But a few months before, how little
could I have imagined, or anticipated,
that I should become a soldier and be
situated as I was then&mdash;a lonely sentinel
amid the mountains of Brittany!  I
thought with some growing repugnance
of war, its cruelties and stern necessities&mdash;the
precipitate execution of the two
unfortunate spies, and the mangled corpses
of the slain seamen, whom I had seen
flung like lumber from the lower deck
ports of the <i>Success</i>, after she engaged
the battery in the Bay of Cancalle, and a
shudder came over me, for I was young
to such work as this.
</p>

<p>
I thought of the green mountains of
my native land&mdash;that lovely Borderland,
and its chain of hills that rise from sea to
sea, between the sister kingdoms, with
their fertile glens where herd and hirsel
grazed in peace; where the brown eagle
had his eyry in the grey rocks, and the
black raven soared high in mid-air or
came swooping down when the silvery
salmon, or the spotted trout leaped up
from the plashing linn&mdash;the land where
every cairn and wood, tower and tree, had
some wild or warlike legend of the past.
</p>

<p>
Old Netherwood, too, with the lazy
rooks that cawed among its oaks, or
roosted on the creaking vanes of its
time-worn turrets.  Then I turned away my
thoughts in anger to the secluded Border
village, where I had been so long a drudge,
yea a very slave; but with the memory
of old Nathan's inky desk, came a pleasant
vision of the pretty little Ruth&mdash;Ruth
whom I had well-nigh forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Was Ruth unmarried still?  Did she
ever think of me?  I could almost laugh
at my first love already, for to this heresy
will the mind come at times, and in
barracks I had reached it already.
</p>

<p>
And then Aurora&mdash;my gay and dashing
cousin Aurora&mdash;the fair usurper of all
that was mine, did she ever think of me,
and our race on Banstead Downs?  And
so, soaring away into the realms of fancy,
I forgot all about the pass in my front
and the picket in my rear, till the sudden
and confused explosion of some twenty
carbines about a hundred yards distant,
on my right, all flashing redly through
the darkness, gave me a start, a shock, as
if struck by lightning; and before I had
time to think or act, there came the rush
of many hoofs, and then a party of
French Hussars, all fleetly mounted,
swept past me from the rear, and fled
towards the pass, pursued by our picket,
which was led by Captain Brook in
person!  My horse reared wildly as they
all passed me, and for about ten minutes
I remained irresolute and ignorant what
to do, until the captain with the main
body of the picket all safe and
untouched, but breathless and highly
excited, came back at a hand gallop.
</p>

<p>
Now, for the first time I discovered
that during my luckless reverie a party
of French light horse, commanded, it
afterwards appeared, by the Chevalier de
Boisguiller, an officer of dashing bravery,
had crept past me at the distance of fifty
yards or so, and unmolested and
unchallenged, had actually ridden so close to
Brook's picket, that they were first
discovered by their sabres glittering in the
light of the watchfire, near which the
captain was seated.
</p>

<p>
Brook's face was crimson, and his voice
hoarse with rage and passion when he
accosted me, and in a minute more I
found myself dismounted, disarmed, and
standing a prisoner before him, a dragoon
being on each side of me with his carbine
loaded.
</p>

<p>
The captain was a handsome and
soldierlike man, somewhere about forty-five
years of age, and the blue uniform of
the 11th Light Dragoons, faced and
lapelled with buff to the waist, and richly
laced with gold, became him well.  His
features, though naturally of a grave and
mild cast, were now stern, and his eyes
sparkled with anger.  I could see all this
by the light of a torch, held by one of the
11th, and I could perceive also that my
comrades of the Greys regarded me with
aught but pleasant faces, as I had involved
the honour of the corps by my negligence.
</p>

<p>
"So&mdash;so&mdash;s'death, you are a fine fellow
to act as a vidette!" began the captain,
with scorn and wrath in his tone; "thanks
to you, we have had an alert with a
vengeance!  You are now aware, that while
asleep you have permitted a body of the
enemy's cavalry to pass your post&mdash;a
body which, if strong enough, would
have cut this picket to pieces."
</p>

<p>
"Under favour, sir, I was not asleep,"
said I, firmly.
</p>

<p>
"Zounds, sirrah, it matters little!  But
do you know what the 'Articles of
War' say concerning conduct such as
yours?"
</p>

<p>
I was silent.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I tell you?" asked the captain,
earnestly, and in a lower tone.
</p>

<p>
"If you please."
</p>

<p>
"They state that any officer or soldier
who shall shamefully abandon any fortress,
<i>post or guard</i>, committed to his charge, or
who shall be found sleeping on his post,
whether upon the land or the sea, shall
suffer DEATH, or such other punishment as
a court martial may award."
</p>

<p>
I was so completely stunned by all
this as to be incapable of speech; but
Duff of ours, a kind and grey-haired old
sergeant, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Captain Brook, the lad is a good lad,
and a steady one; we have few better in
the Greys&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then I am very sorry for the Greys!"
</p>

<p>
"I do hope, sir," continued the sergeant,
"that his life, at least, may not be
forfeited?"
</p>

<p>
"My life!" I exclaimed, mechanically.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that may be forfeited, and I
disgraced!" said Captain Brook, bitterly.
"I have commanded many a post, but
never one that was surprised before.
To-morrow I shall hand you over to the guard
of the provost marshal.  What is your
name, fellow?"
</p>

<p>
"Basil Gauntlet."
</p>

<p>
On hearing this, he started and became
so visibly affected, that the soldiers of the
picket who crowded round us holding
their horses by the bridle, glanced at each
other with inquiry and surprise.  Brook
surveyed me keenly for a moment, and
then a sorrowful frown seemed to deepen
on his features.
</p>

<p>
"Was your father ever in the service?"
he asked, abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"He was an officer of Granby's Dragoons."
</p>

<p>
Then a malignant light sparkled in the
eyes of Captain Brook, and he struck his
spurred heel into the turf.
</p>

<p>
"Was my father your friend?" I asked,
with hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"Friend!" he reiterated, bitterly;
"no&mdash;no&mdash;not my friend.  But your mother,
what of her?" he added, in an altered
voice.
</p>

<p>
"She is in her grave," I replied, with
faltering accent; "else, perhaps, I had
not stood before you thus to-night, a
private soldier and a prisoner."
</p>

<p>
After a pause&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My God!" said Brook, in a low voice,
as he took off his helmet and passed a
hand across his flushed brow.  Then
seeming to recollect himself, he said,
"Fall back, sergeant; and fall back,
men&mdash;picket your horses, and lie down if you
please till daybreak, when the outpickets
are called in.  Leave the prisoner with
me.  Gauntlet," he continued, after we
were somewhat alone, "step with me
this way.  I shall do all in my power to
serve you, and to be your friend."
</p>

<p>
"Sir, you astonish me," I exclaimed;
"how am I so fortunate?"
</p>

<p>
"I will tell you a secret, boy&mdash;a secret
long buried in my heart," he continued,
in a voice that grew soft and kind; "your
father and I were rivals&mdash;rivals for the
love of the same girl, long, long years
ago; but he was the successful wooer&mdash;I
the discarded one!  She was your mother,
boy, and now, for her sacred memory, and
the memory, too, of that early love, which
brightened for a time the first days of my
soldiering, I will save you, my poor lad,
if I can.  Nay more, I have some
interest at head-quarters, and will serve
you as if you had been my own son, and
this will I do for <i>her</i> sake."
</p>

<p>
The voice of Captain Brook trembled,
and I bowed low, for I could not speak.
</p>

<p>
"You know what the rules of the service
prescribe," he resumed, "in such a
case as yours?"
</p>

<p>
"You have already told me, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Death!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Yet, you shall not die, and your
future promotion shall be my peculiar
care.  Comrades," cried he, to the men of
the picket, "in Basil Gauntlet I have
discovered the son of an early and dear
friend.  He is but a young soldier&mdash;a
mere boy, and I would save him if I can."
</p>

<p>
"You may command us, sir," said
Sergeant Duff.
</p>

<p>
"We will do anything for you, Captain
Brook," added the men of the 11th, with
enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"I do not mean to report his
dereliction of duty&mdash;so give me your
words that you will be silent in the
matter."
</p>

<p>
"We swear it, sir!" they exclaimed,
with energy, and that honest pledge was
never broken.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Basil Gauntlet," said Captain
Brook, as he gave me back my sword, and
grasped my hand, while speaking rapidly
and energetically; "you, doubtless, have
your father's courage and spirit of honour.
These are hereditary, and old Sir Basil
could not <i>will them away</i> as he did the
acres of Netherwood, the family pictures,
and the silver spoons.  Be a man, and a
brave one, as your father was&mdash;I knew
him well and hated him&mdash;God rest
him now, for all that.  To-morrow,
I shall see that you are taken out of
the ranks; for, to-night, I can but
share with you the contents of my
canteen."
</p>

<p>
An aide-de-camp now came galloping
from Cancalle to inquire the meaning of
the firing.  Some explanation, I know
not what, was made, and so ended this
remarkable episode, which had a gloomy
sequel on the morrow, when all the bright
future, which the sudden friendship of
Captain Brook had opened to me, was
rapidly overcast.
</p>

<p>
About noon the poor man was killed
by a shot from a French sharpshooter, as
we were advancing through a thick wood.
Dr. Lancelot Probe of ours was speedily
at hand, but my new friend was gone for
ever, and I was one of those who
assisted to wrap his remains in a
horse rug, and to inter them by the
wayside, as we marched towards St. Malo.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
HALT AT ST. SERVAND.
</h3>

<p>
During the 7th of June the whole
force (save one regiment, which was left
at Cancalle to cover our re-embarkation, if
necessary) marched towards St. Malo,
through a rough and woody country.
A dense mist from the ocean enveloped
the scenery for some miles inland, and
through this we were advancing when
Captain Brook was killed.  The soil
seemed barren, with black sheep grazing
among the rocks and boulders; old and
ruinous bridges lay across deep swamps
and rugged watercourses, that rushed
towards the sea.  Without molestation
we passed several quaint, old manor
houses, girdled by weedy fosses and
moss-grown oaks&mdash;and some whose embattled
<i>porte cocher</i> and grated casements opened
to long and shady avenues of sycamore
trees.
</p>

<p>
Ere long, we came to more open parts
of the country, covered with pink heath
and spotted with yellow flowers; in others,
with fields, snow white with the bloom of
buckwheat.  In these flat places rose
here and there, exactly as in Scotland,
great battle stones of the Druids or the
Celtic Bretons, that stood grim, grey,
erect, solemn and silent; and so a march
of nine miles through scenery such as this
brought us in sight of St. Malo.
</p>

<p>
The men of our troop were so much
occupied in scouring the district through
which the infantry advanced, covering
both flanks, reconnoitring and so forth,
that it was not until sunset when our
small army encamped at the village of
St. Servand, two miles from St. Malo,
that I had an opportunity of relating to
my two chief friends, Tom Kirkton and
Jack Charters, the strange adventure of
the preceding night.
</p>

<p>
They listened to me with astonishment,
as we sat by the foot of a large tree under
which our horses were stabled (if I may
use such a term), and where we were
regaling ourselves with ration biscuits and
the contents of a gallon keg of French
wine, of which Charters had become
proprietor on the march.
</p>

<p>
Around us the whole force, horse, foot,
and artillery, were busy cooking or
preparing for the bivouac of the night.
Countless little fires, lighted beside trees,
hedges, and low walls, glared and reddened
in the evening wind, and when the dusk
set in, they shed a wavering gleam on the
piles of arms that stood in long ranks, on
the white bell-tents and the red-coated
groups that loitered near.  The whole
scene was picturesque, lively, and striking,
and in the distance lay the town and
fortress of St. Malo, quaint and worn by
time and the misty storms that came from
the open sea.
</p>

<p>
Its harbour is one of the best seaports
in France, but is extremely difficult of
access.  The town is small, gloomy, and
dull, but populous and wealthy, and crowns
a rock which the sea encompasses twice
daily&mdash;thus St. Malo is alternately insular
and peninsular, as the tide ebbs, flows, and
churns in foam against its fetid rocks,
whereon the russet-brown seaweed rots in
the sunshine; and far around it lies a
barrier of sharp white reefs, the foe of
many a ship ere beacons were invented.
</p>

<p>
It was guarded by a strong castle,
flanked by great towers, on the battlements
of which the last light of the setting sun
yet lingered with a fiery gleam.  The town
had usually a good garrison; but His
Grace the Duke of Marlborough had now
learned that there were not quite five
hundred troops in the whole of this
neglected province of Brittany, which,
though forming a portion of the kingdom
of France, had long been under its
hereditary dukes, and was now governed
by a States General, with provincial
privileges of its own.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* It continued so until the Revolution in 1792.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
For ages so separate had its interests
been from those of France, that James III. of
Scotland was requested by Charles VIII. to
send thither a body of troops to capture
and annex Brittany to his northern kingdom
but the Scottish parliament declined
to sanction the subjugation of a free
people; so this strange scheme was
abandoned.
</p>

<p>
A strong wall surrounded St. Malo, and
every night twelve dogs of great size and
ferocity were led round it by a soldier of
the city watch, that their barking might
give notice if brigands or an enemy approached.
</p>

<p>
The last ray of sunlight soon faded
upward from the cathedral spire of
St. Vincent, and the shades of twilight were
already casting into obscurity the rocky
basement of the whole city and its weedy
reefs amid the chafing sea, when in a lonely
part of our camp by St. Servand my two
comrades and I reclined on the turf beside
our accoutred horses, and drank the
contents of the wine-keg, using one horn&mdash;for
we possessed but one&mdash;fraternally by
turns.
</p>

<p>
"It is very true," continued Charters,
with reference to my adventure of the
preceding night; "egad, friend Gauntlet,
you had a narrow escape!  In other
hands&mdash;particularly those of old Preston&mdash;you
had assuredly been brought to the drum-head
and had a volley of ten carbines for
dereliction of duty.  To fall asleep on
one's post before an enemy&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But I was <i>not</i> asleep," I persisted.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well; but to let the enemy pass
you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking of other times, Jack."
</p>

<p>
"Very likely," said Kirkton; "on such
a lonely duty, and at such a time, by night,
I have too often found the thoughts of
other times, and images of those I have
loved or lost, who are dead, or far, far
away, all come unbidden before me."
</p>

<p>
"It is unwise to look back regretfully&mdash;for
the past can never come again.  Oh,
never more!" continued Charters, sadly,
as he thought of some cherished episode
of his own life; "so the wiser and the
manlier way is to improve the present
(pass the keg, Tom), and look boldly at
the future."
</p>

<p>
"You are right, Jack," said I, as this
military philosopher proceeded to light his
pipe and groom his horse, which he
carefully covered with his cloak; "but I fear
it will be long before I can school myself
into your cool way of taking things.  I
have seen but little of the world, Jack,
and have only learned to enjoy life since
embracing the profession which sets no
value upon it."
</p>

<p>
"Time and travel will improve your
views, my boy; and 'all travel,' says
Dr. Johnson, 'has its advantages; if it lead
a man to a better country, he learns to
improve his own; if to a worse, to enjoy
it.'  I have travelled much in my time&mdash;steady,
old horse, steady!&mdash;and as I did
so with sundry rounds of ball cartridge
at my back, I have learned much that
Dr. Johnson never thought of."
</p>

<p>
"In what way, Jack&mdash;to handle a
dice-box and make love to the barmaids?"
asked Tom.
</p>

<p>
"I have learned more than that,"
retorted Charters, somewhat coldly; "travel
taught me to be charitable; for one finds
good people everywhere, abroad as well as
at home, for as it takes a great many men
to make an army, so many people are
required to make a nation."
</p>

<p>
"Bah!" shouted Tom Kirkton, who
was in his shirt-sleeves and attending to
our cooking; "we have had enough of
musty moralising.  This is like one of old
father's sermons, poor man! and a sermon
sounds oddly in your mouth, Jack.  Here
is a rasher of bacon, broiled on a ramrod
and done to a turn.  Come here while
it is hot and savoury, for we may
say with the fool in the Scripture,
'Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow
we die.'"
</p>

<p>
"Boot and saddle!  To horse, you fellows
there!" cried the loud and authoritative
voice of a staff officer as a strange sequel
to Tom's ominous speech.  He proved to be
General Elliot, who was passing through
our bivouac at a hand gallop, accompanied
by his aide-de-camp, both plumed and
aiguiletted.  "To horse&mdash;the Light Dragoons!"
</p>

<p>
"Fall in&mdash;the Scots Greys!" added
Captain Lindsay, coming up at a trot;
"we are ordered to the front."
</p>

<p>
So Tom's dainty rasher was eaten in a
trice; the last of Charters's wine was
drained, the keg tossed into the nearest
watch fire, we sprang on our horses,
and at the first ruffle on the kettle-drum,
formed line on the left of our
standard.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
THE SACK OF ST. SOLIDORE.
</h3>

<p>
Like all who are so subordinate in rank,
we fell in and formed, in total ignorance
of where we were going, or what we were
to do; who we were to attack, or by whom
we might be attacked; and, perhaps, not
caring much about the matter, provided
we were to do something.
</p>

<p>
In the dusk the roll was called; the
troop "proved" and formed in column
with the other light troops under Elliot,
the future "Cock of the Rock."  We
loaded our carbines and pistols, and then
the order was given&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Threes right&mdash;forward&mdash;trot!" and
away we went.
</p>

<p>
Though we had been imbibing only
French wine, we three comrades were not
in a very reputable condition; but,
fortunately, this could not be perceived in the
twilight; though Charters was unusually
lively, and my skill was frequently tested,
as I was generally the flanker of a squadron,
being completely master of my horse.
</p>

<p>
In the leading section of three, there
was a gigantic trooper before us, named
Hob Elliot.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, Hob, what a noble pair of
shoulders you have!" said Charters, as we
trotted on; "what a mark your back will
be for our friends the French!"
</p>

<p>
"If they ever <i>see</i> it," growled the
Borderer, for he was a Liddesdale man.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, Gauntlet," hiccupped Charters,
then turning to me; "head up, and
thumb on the bridle&mdash;you have quite the
air of a soldier!"
</p>

<p>
"I always study to <i>be</i> what I wish to
seem," said I.
</p>

<p>
"So said Socrates," added Tom Kirkton,
remembering his classics.
</p>

<p>
"Ugh! he quotes Socrates on the line
of march."
</p>

<p>
"Well," rejoined Tom; "he was a private
soldier like ourselves, and saved the
life of Xenophon."
</p>

<p>
"Be silent, my lads," said Captain
Lindsay; "we have work in hand that
requires you to be so."
</p>

<p>
As we quitted our bivouac, I was more
than ever struck with its picturesque
aspect.  Some regiments of infantry
(among them the 8th, 20th, and 25th),
which had not yet been ordered under
arms, were lying around their watchfires
in a green clover field.  These fires could
not have been less than ninety or a hundred
in number, and their united glare fell
redly on the sunburned faces and scarlet
uniforms of the scattered groups who sat
around them; on the lines of those who
lay asleep with their knapsacks for pillows;
on the long rows of muskets, piled with
bayonets fixed, and on the silk colours,
that drooped before the guarded tent of
each commanding officer.
</p>

<p>
Beyond these were the dark figures of
the active artillery, limbering up, tracing
their horses to the field guns, and
preparing for immediate service; and as fresh
fuel was cast on those watchfires, and the
weird light flared up anew, it brought out
in strong relief objects at a greater
distance; trees and rocks were visible for a
time, and then, as the flame wavered and
sunk, they faded into obscurity.  Add to
all this, that the night was intensely dark,
and the atmosphere dense and sulphury.
</p>

<p>
Nor moon nor star were visible; the
wind was still, and the flames of the
crackling watchfires burned steadily and high.
</p>

<p>
"Where are we going&mdash;what are we to
be about?" we now inquired of each
other as we rode on; and ere long, from
mouth to mouth, as the staff officers,
perhaps, unwisely informed those
commanding troops, and these, in turn their
subs, we learned that the Duke of
Marlborough had, during the day, reconnoitred
the harbour and suburbs of St. Malo, with
the shipping and government stores, and
had resolved on their destruction; so we
were now to cover the advance of a body
of infantry and artillery who were to
perform this duty, with shot, shell, and
hand grenades.
</p>

<p>
While advancing, I overheard Captain
Lindsay say to Cornet Keith of ours&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Marlborough has heard that the
youngest and favourite daughter of the
Marshal de Broglie, who now commands
in Germany, resides in a chateau near
St. Malo; and he thinks she would prove an
important capture."
</p>

<p>
"Nay&mdash;pshaw&mdash;zounds, gallantry
forbid!" responded the cornet, who was
carrying the standard.
</p>

<p>
"I heard him say he would give a
hundred and fifty guineas for her,"
continued Lindsay.
</p>

<p>
"For what purpose?" asked Keith, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"To send to London as a trophy, like
the brass guns we hope to take at Cherbourg."
</p>

<p>
"A sorry capture, unless the girl is
beautiful."
</p>

<p>
After proceeding about half a mile, our
troop was ordered to press forward to the
front, while the others reined up; then,
as the artillery halted, and the deep
hollow rumbling of the wheels and
shot-laden tumbrils ceased, we could hear the
flowing tide chafing in the dark on the
bluff rocks of St. Malo, and, ere long, we
saw the red lights that twinkled in its
streets and fortress which towered above
the ocean.
</p>

<p>
Girt as it was by deep waves and
lofty walls, "the city of the corsairs," as
some one names it, was secure from us then;
so we rode on till we reached an open
space, when the order came to form line
on the leading section, and then the whizz,
whizz, whizzing of balls, together with
the rapid flashing of carbines in front,
announced that the foe was before us.
</p>

<p>
My temples throbbed; there was a wild
glow in my heart, and then an emotion of
terror, as a bullet struck me fairly in the
centre of the breast, above my pouch belt.
For an instant I thought it was through
me, and breathlessly dropped my reins;
then, instinctively, I placed my hand
within my coat, and expecting to find it
covered with blood, drew forth&mdash;what?
Aurora's handkerchief.  It had saved me
from the ball, which pierced my coat,
though half spent.
</p>

<p>
I pressed it to my parched lips in
gratitude; and perfume was lingering about
it still.  I had scarcely replaced it and
recovered my equanimity, when I heard
the clear, firm voice of Captain Lindsay,
as he rode to the front, with young Keith
by his side, carrying the standard advanced.
</p>

<p>
"Cavalry are before us, and we must
clear the way.  March&mdash;trot! keep your
horses well in hand&mdash;press on by leg and
spur!"
</p>

<p>
We advanced, with drawn swords, the
troop riding on, boot to boot, and thigh
to thigh&mdash;moving like a living wall.  Then
rapidly followed the words&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Gallop&mdash;<i>charge!</i>" mingling with the
sharp blast of the trumpet, and totally
ignorant of what was amid the darkness
in our front, whether a column of cavalry,
a yawning chasm, or a stone rampart, we
rushed blindly and furiously on with a
loud and ringing cheer.
</p>

<p>
We charged with tremendous force, and
in the heat, hurry, and confusion of such
a moment, performed at racing speed, I
sat in my saddle and guided my horse
with a combined coolness and steadiness
that certainly resulted from mere instinct
or force of habit, rather than reason.  I
felt as in a dream, till suddenly, out of
the darkness in front, there came before
me a line of horses' heads, with another
line of human faces, and uplifted swords
above them.  Then there was a wild crash,
as if the earth had opened, when horse
and man went tumbling under us, as we
swept over the enemy, cutting and treading
them down.
</p>

<p>
"Tuè!  Tuè!" cried they; "St. Malo
for Brittany!"  But their provincial patron
availed them not.
</p>

<p>
They proved to be a mere handful of
hussars, led by the Chevalier de Boisguiller,
who was nearly killed by the sword of
Charters; but escaped by having an iron
calotte cap within his fur cap.  We lost
only three men in this charge; but found
nine of the enemy lying dead on the
ground next day.
</p>

<p>
In vain the Chevalier, an officer of the
most romantic courage, endeavoured to
rally his men.
</p>

<p>
"<i>En avant, mes camarades&mdash;Mes enfans,
en avant!</i>" we heard him shout, while
brandishing his sabre; "<i>Voilà&mdash;voilà, c'est la
voye à l'honneur, à la gloire, à la victoire!
Vive le Roi!</i>"
</p>

<p>
As they fled there was no pursuit, for
the trumpet sounded to recal stragglers.
</p>

<p>
Then we reformed line and wheeled
back, to permit the infantry and artillery
to pass to the front.  After this, our orders
were simply to guard and patrol the
approaches to St. Solidore, against which our
comrades on foot commenced the most
active operations.
</p>

<p>
I have no intention of detailing the
whole of these, nor could I do so, perhaps,
if willing; but never shall I forget the
splendour of the terrible scene which
ensued, when the fires of destruction spread
along the suburbs of St. Solidore and
St. Servand, and all around the harbour of
St. Malo.
</p>

<p>
Through the dark sky we saw the shells
fired by our artillery describing long arcs
of light, and bursting like fiery stars or
flaming comets among the rigging of the
ships in the basin, or on the roofs of the
stores and houses on the quay.  Then the
shrieks and cries of the fugitive people
came towards us through the still night
air, together with the incessant explosion
of the hand grenades, which our grenadiers,
as they advanced alongside the ships, threw
point blank on their decks, and down the
open hatchways.
</p>

<p>
The most deadly missiles were the <i>anchor
balls</i>, fired by our artillery.
</p>

<p>
These were filled with powder, saltpetre,
sulphur, resin, and turpentine, and had
an iron bar, one half of which was within
and the other outside the shell.  The
latter half was armed with a grappling-hook,
which caught the rigging of the ships,
or the walls or roofs of houses, as the
heaviest end flew foremost, and by these
chiefly the whole place was soon sheeted
with flaming pyramids, amid which we saw
walls crumbling and descending, and masts
and yards disappearing amid mountains of
sparks and burning brands, while torrents
of red fire poured from every door and
window round the whole circle of the harbour.
</p>

<p>
The sky was full of red clouds and
sheets of red sparks; the harbour and the
bay beyond were all ruddied, as if changed
to port wine, and the whole air became
filled with roaring flame.
</p>

<p>
High over all this towered St. Malo on
its rock, and on its embattled walls, its
gothic spires and storm-beaten cliffs,
redly fell the glare of destruction; while
at times we heard the barking of the watch
dogs, and could see the gleam of arms
along the ramparts, for every citizen was
in harness, and from mouth to mouth
went the cry.
</p>

<p>
"St. Malo for Brittany! the women
to their homes, and the men to their
muskets!"
</p>

<p>
But, though they knew it not, we had
no idea then of assailing a place so strong
by art and nature.
</p>

<p>
The naval storehouses, full of sails,
ropes, tar, pitch, oil, paint and powder,
blazed the whole night, exhibiting every
variety of prismatic colours, but ere
morning, ships, houses, and magazines were
all confounded in one mass of charred and
blackened ashes.
</p>

<p>
We destroyed in the docks and in the
harbour thirteen vessels of war, mounting
two hundred and thirty-four guns,
with seventy-three merchant ships, and
£800,000 worth of property, after which
we retired with the loss of only twelve
men, three of whom were seamen, killed
by a single random shot from St. Malo.
</p>

<p>
During this wild scene, there was
something singular, almost touching, in
the terror of the poor birds, when the air
became alive with soaring and bursting
shells, with showers of shot, thick with
smoke, laden with the booming of the
ordnance and the ceaseless roar of the
conflagration.
</p>

<p>
Crows, larks, pigeons, and sparrows
seemed to become paralysed by fear; they
fluttered, panted, and grovelled among the
long grass and under the hedgerows, in
some instances crouching and hiding
themselves in little coveys close to the
dead and wounded Hussars (who lay
where we had charged), as if to rebuke
the spirit in man that made of earth a
hell!
</p>

<p>
And so thought I, when weary, wan,
and pale, I retired with the troop towards
our camp on the hills of Paramé.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
AN EPISODE.
</h3>

<p>
As the column of light cavalry wheeled
off by sections to return to the camp and
bivouac, a staff officer who was riding
hurriedly past in the dark addressed me&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Young man," said he, "do you see
those lights twinkling in the hollow
yonder?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; the port fires of the artillery."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly; ride with all speed to the
officer commanding the brigade of guns,
and say it is the order of General
Elliot that he falls back at once towards
the hills of Paramé."
</p>

<p>
I bowed, for the speaker was the general
in person.
</p>

<p>
To execute this order, I had to ride
nearly a mile to the rear, skirting the wide
stretch of sand that lies between St. Malo
and St. Servand.  The morning was still
quite dark, and the fires yet smouldered
redly in the dockyards and harbour, while
a heavy smoke and odour of burning
loaded the air, which was very still and
oppressive.
</p>

<p>
I rode towards the place, where the
matches of the artillery shone brilliantly;
but I had scarcely reached the flank of
the brigade, when the whole force got into
motion at a rapid trot, the gunners on
their seats, and the drivers plying well
their whips, as they wheeled off towards
the hills with a tremendous noise, chains,
shot, rammers, spunges, and buckets all
swinging and clattering.  Thus I had
no occasion to deliver the anticipated
orders of General Elliot; but as the
artillerymen were driving with such fury,
I reined up to let them pass, and followed
leisurely in their rear.
</p>

<p>
Day was now beginning to break, and
the summits of the hills and the spires of
the city of St. Malo&mdash;in the dark ages
the abode of saints, in more modern
times the asylum of criminals&mdash;were
brightening in the ruddy gloom; but
smoke hung like a sombre pall over all
the harbour below.
</p>

<p>
From time to time I could hear in the
distance the hollow bay of the fierce dogs
which watched the city walls, a custom
that was not abolished until 1770, when
one night they tore to pieces and devoured
a naval officer.
</p>

<p>
The sound of water plashing by the
wayside drew my horse towards it.  The
poor animal was thirsty after the long and
weary patrol duty of the past night.  The
stream poured from a rock, and through
a moss-green wooden duct fell into the
stone basin of a wayside well, and there,
while my horse drunk long and thirstily, I
heard the rumble of the artillery as they
passed away among the echoing mountains
and I was left alone in the rear.
</p>

<p>
By the roadside near the fountain, there
grew a dense thicket of mulberry trees
and wild broom-bushes, from amid which&mdash;just
as I was turning my horse to ride off&mdash;there
rung a half-stifled cry, followed by a
fierce and very unmistakeable malediction
in French&mdash;for that language, and not
the old Armoric, is spoken by the Bretons
of Dol and St. Malo.
</p>

<p>
Supposing that some unfortunate
English straggler or wounded man might
be lying there at the mercy of some of
the enemy, I drew a pistol from my
holsters and dismounted.  My horse was
so well trained, that I knew he would
remain where I left him, while penetrating
into the thicket.  The gloom of the latter
was excessive, but day was breaking, and
a faint light stole between the slender
stems of the trees.
</p>

<p>
Two figures now appeared&mdash;those of a
man and woman.  Having come close
upon them unobserved, I now shrunk
behind a bush to watch.  The woman
was on her knees, and her left shoulder
reclined against the root of a tree; her
whole attitude indicated weariness or
despair, or both together.  Her hands
were tied with a scarf or handkerchief,
and her dark hair hung over her face so
as to conceal her features entirely.
Close by her, and with one hand resting
against the same tree, the man stood
erect, but looking down, and surveying
her with some solicitude, or at least with
interest.  He wore a peasant's frock of
blue linen, girt at the waist by a belt
with a square buckle.  He was armed
with a small hatchet and <i>couteau de
chasse</i>, and carried in his right hand a
knotted cudgel.
</p>

<p>
They were quite silent; at least I heard
only from time to time the half-stifled
sobs of the female.
</p>

<p>
"Here is some mystery or premeditated
mischief," thought I; "let me watch
warily."
</p>

<p>
At last the woman said faintly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Release me!"
</p>

<p>
The man uttered a growling guttural laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Release me, I implore you!" she continued
in a voice of great softness and
pathos.
</p>

<p>
"For the hundredth time you have
thus implored me, mademoiselle, and for
the hundredth time I reply&mdash;never."
</p>

<p>
"My father&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tonnerre de Ciel!</i> don't speak to me of
your father," said the man, grinding his
teeth; "I was an honest woodcutter in
the Black Forest of Hunandaye till he
ruined me."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible! my good father is
incapable of such a thing."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing is impossible to dukes and
peers of France, who have the Bastille
and the dungeons of their own chateaux
at their command."
</p>

<p>
"But he ruined you?  Alas! how?"
</p>

<p>
"By permitting his nephew&mdash;the
Comte de Bourgneuf&mdash;to carry off my
sister; and because I resented the act,
he had my cottage demolished, my
mother driven into the forest where she
was devoured by wolves, and myself he
chained to work like a felon on the roads
and ramparts of St. Malo and the
aqueducts at Dol."
</p>

<p>
"Alas! monsieur, I swear to you that
my father was blameless in all this, and
even were it not so, why are you so
merciless to me&mdash;why make me thus
your prisoner?"
</p>

<p>
"Because you are beautiful," said the
fellow, with a grating laugh.  "Despite
these wrongs, I risked my life for France,
or rather for French gold.  I have been
at the bottom of the sea, <i>pardieu!</i> and
am now on firm land.  I have been dead,
and am come alive again!  Ha! ha!
Bourgneuf carried off my sister.  I carry
off you&mdash;<i>chacun à son gout</i>&mdash;(every man to
his taste.")
</p>

<p>
"Ah! have mercy.  See how I weep."
</p>

<p>
"Of course; weeping is a complaint
that is very common among women.  The
count took my sister to Paris, and she
was never heard of again.  I shall take
you to the Black Forest of Hunandaye,
and never shall you be heard of either,
unless your friends are rash enough to
seek you in the subterranean torrent of
St. Aubin du Cormier."
</p>

<p>
"This fellow is mad; but whether mad
or not, I must save the poor girl at all
hazards," thought I, while shaking the
priming in the pan of my holster pistol.
</p>

<p>
"Have you no dread of punishment,
for thus daring to molest me?" demanded
the lady.
</p>

<p>
"No.  Neither here nor hereafter.
You shall live with me in the forest, and
when tired of you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I shall escape and proclaim you."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Pardieu!</i> you won't, my beauty;
because I shall kill you, and your
disappearance will, like the king's ships, be
set down to the score of these pestilent
English, who have come hither to turn
our Brittany upside down.  Besides, who
knows that <i>I</i> have carried you off?"
</p>

<p>
"And you will kill me&mdash;I, who never
harmed you in thought, in word, or
deed?" said she, with a shudder.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he hissed through his clenched teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, horror!  Will no one rescue me?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oui!  Sacré!</i>  Kill you quietly and
secretly, even as I killed quietly and
surely the English captain of the Chevaux
Legers in the wood near Cancalle yesterday."
</p>

<p>
I started on hearing this, for the
assassin of poor Captain Brook of the
11th was now covered by the muzzle of
<i>my</i> weapon.  The speaker was a tall,
rawboned fellow, whose form exhibited
great strength and stature; he had a
shambling gait, and a dirty visage of a
very bilious complexion.  His hair was
black and shaggy; he had dark lacklustre
eyes and large, fierce, blubberlike
lips, yellowed as his broken fangs were by
coarse tobacco juice.  I had somewhere
before seen this hideous face, the features
of which gradually came to view as the
increasing light stole gradually through
the mulberry wood.  How was it that
this countenance, so pale and repulsive,
the forehead which receded like that of a
hound, the immense frontal bones, and
the square jaw like that of a tiger, were
in some sort not unfamiliar to me?
</p>

<p>
Though torn and in wild disorder, the
dress of his prisoner, grey silk brocaded
with white, evinced that she was of some
rank, and her arms, which her tattered
sleeves displayed almost to the shoulder,
were beautiful in form and of exceeding
delicacy.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Nombril de Belzebub!</i>" said he,
suddenly, as he ground his teeth.  "Come,
come, we've had enough of this.  Let us
begone, lest those English wolves
return."
</p>

<p>
Then the girl uttered a pitiful cry, as
his huge knotty hand grasped her slender
wrists.
</p>

<p>
"Kill me now!" she implored; "for
mercy's sake, kill me now!"
</p>

<p>
"By no means, my beauty&mdash;you must
first see the black dingles of Hunandaye.
I may kiss you as often as you please,
but as for killing, until I weary of you,
<i>pardieu!</i> there is no chance of that."
</p>

<p>
He was now proceeding to drag her
along the ground, when I rushed forward,
and by a blow of my sword, felled the
savage to the ground.  A small cap of
thick fur which he wore saved him from
being cut, but not from the weight of a
stunning blow.
</p>

<p>
With a dreadful Breton oath he
leaped up, and with uplifted cudgel was
springing on me, when on seeing my
levelled pistol he paused and shrunk back,
with a terrible expression of baffled rage
and ferocity in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Judge then of my astonishment on
recognising in this hideous fellow the
pretended French deserter, the spy,
Theophile Damien or Hautois, whom I
had met at Portsmouth&mdash;whom I had
seen run up to the yardarm of the <i>Essex</i>,
and from thence consigned to the deep
with a cold thirty-two pound shot at his
heels!

CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
JACQUELINE.
</h3>

<p>
Had this man a charmed life? was he a
vampire, a devil, or what? thought I, as
we surveyed each other, and I have no
doubt he recognised me, as he had seen
me thrice before.  I released the lady's
hands from the handkerchief which bound
them, and then raised her from the
ground.
</p>

<p>
Hautois again lifted his bludgeon
menacingly, but lowered it when I levelled
my pistol straight at his head.
</p>

<p>
"Pass on, fellow&mdash;begone," said I, "or
I shall pistol you without mercy.  After
our work last night, you cannot imagine
that taking a Frenchman's life&mdash;especially
yours&mdash;is a matter of much importance
to me."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sangdieu!</i>" he growled, "what
business have you to interfere here?"
</p>

<p>
"Business&mdash;rascal!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;this woman is my wife, who
wishes to run away from me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, horror! oh, absurdity!" exclaimed
the young lady, as she gathered her dark
hair back from her face with her pretty
hands, and shrunk close to me.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sangdieu</i>&mdash;yes, my wife, I tell you,"
shouted the fellow, with a hand on the
<i>couteau de chasse</i> in his girdle; but I
replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I have overheard enough to prove that
you lie, villain; so begone at once, I say,
or be punished as you deserve.  Come,
madam, permit me to assist you; my
horse is close by, and from our camp at
Paramé you shall have a safe escort to
your home."
</p>

<p>
She took my proffered hand with a
very mingled or doubtful expression of
face, for I was a stranger, a soldier, an
enemy; but she had only a choice of evils,
and knew that probably she could not
fall into worse hands than those from
which I took her.  Then as I was leading
her away, with her dark eyes fixed in
terror and aversion on Hautois, she uttered
a shrill cry which made me start and turn
round; and I did so just in time to escape
a deadly thrust aimed at my back.
Indeed, the sharp blade of the <i>couteau de
chasse</i> passed through my coat, grazing
my left ribs, and almost severing my buff
waist-belt.
</p>

<p>
Exasperated by this, I resolved to pistol
the ruffian at once, and shot him through
the jaws.  On this, he fell on his face,
wallowing in blood, and rolled among the
long grass, with his hands pressed upon
the wound in each cheek.  The wretch
was only wounded, however, not killed.
The girl whom I had rescued was fainting
with terror at this scene, so I hurried her
off to where my horse still stood quietly
by the wayside well.
</p>

<p>
Day had completely broken now, and I
could perceive that my fair companion was
undoubtedly a young lady of great beauty
and polished manners.  She was ghastly
pale, doubtless with the terrors of the past
night, and the extreme darkness of her hair
and eyes served but to increase, by
contrast, the pallor of her complexion.  Her
hands, which were without gloves, proved
her high breeding and delicate nurture,
by their charming form and whiteness.
The morning air was chill and damp, for
the dews of night yet gemmed every leaf
and blade of grass; and she shuddered
with cold or fear, for she was without a
head-dress, and her general attire was
rather thin and scanty.
</p>

<p>
"You will permit me," said I, taking
the cloak from my saddle and wrapping it
round her; "and now say, to where can I
escort you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not to the British camp, if possible,
I pray you," she replied, while beginning
to weep freely.
</p>

<p>
"I dare not be absent long," said I;
"my duty leads me there, and by
straggling, or loitering here&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"True&mdash;true, <i>ah, mon Dieu!</i> how selfish
of me! you risk your life, perhaps, at the
hands of our exasperated peasantry."
</p>

<p>
"Madam, I risk my life daily for a
trooper's pay," said I, smiling: "so freely
may I peril it for one so&mdash;so lovely as you."
</p>

<p>
She coloured at this reply, and drew
back, on which I added, with a low bow,
while my cheek reddened also&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me&mdash;I forget myself."
</p>

<p>
"This is not the bearing or the language
of an English private soldier," said
she, approaching me again, placing her
pretty hand upon my arm, and looking
pleadingly in my face.
</p>

<p>
"Madam, though but a <i>simple soldat&mdash;un
Ecossais Gris</i>, I am a gentleman, and
have never done aught to disgrace my name."
</p>

<p>
"Then you will protect me, sir, will you not?"
</p>

<p>
"As I have already done, at the peril
of my life."
</p>

<p>
"And <i>not</i> take me to the camp?"
</p>

<p>
"Not if safer shelter can be found."
</p>

<p>
"Even if I tell you who I am?" she
continued, with a proud smile.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but who&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am the daughter of a French soldier."
</p>

<p>
"Thus you have an additional claim on
my honour, madam."
</p>

<p>
"Mademoiselle&mdash;I am unmarried," she
urged, with the faintest approach to
coquetry in her dark eyes.
</p>

<p>
"And the daughter of a soldier, say you?"
</p>

<p>
"Le Maréchal Duc de Broglie."
</p>

<p>
"Who now commands in Germany?"
I continued, with growing interest.
</p>

<p>
"The same, monsieur."
</p>

<p>
The scrap of conversation I had overheard
between Captain Lindsay and Cornet
Keith, during the night march, now
flashed upon my memory.
</p>

<p>
"Pray tell no one else who you are,"
said I, hurriedly, while looking around me.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Pourquoi, monsieur?</i>" she asked, with
almost hauteur.
</p>

<p>
"Because I heard an officer of rank
say, that he would give a hundred
and fifty English guineas to have you
taken prisoner, and sent to London as a
trophy."
</p>

<p>
She trembled and shrunk back on
hearing this, lifting up her white hands
deprecatingly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh be not alarmed, Mademoiselle de
Broglie," said I, "for I would rather die
than betray you."
</p>

<p>
"And how much may this reward be
in French money?"
</p>

<p>
"About two thousand livres."
</p>

<p>
"Two thousand livres," she exclaimed,
with a haughty laugh and a flashing eye;
"they hold me cheap, indeed, who offer this!"
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, mademoiselle," said I,
anxiously, "but I have no time to lose in
having you conveyed to a place of safety.
If absent from morning roll call, my
punishment will not be slight.  The
peasantry have all fled inland&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But surely in some farmhouse or
cottage I may find shelter."
</p>

<p>
"How comes it to pass the ruffian
Hautois is still alive?" I asked, as we
walked along the road with the bridle of
my horse over my arm.  "He was cast into
the sea from the yard-arm of our commodore's
ship, with a cannon shot at his heels."
</p>

<p>
"From which the shot parted, by the rope
giving way, as he sank into the water."
</p>

<p>
"Parted?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oui, monsieur</i>; so he told me; and
thereupon he immediately rose to the
surface and swam to the shore, while his
less fortunate companion was instantly
drowned."
</p>

<p>
"And how came you to be in his
power? pardon my curiosity."
</p>

<p>
"It is most natural; I shall tell you,
monsieur.  Fearing that the province was
to be overrun by your troops, we left our
Chateau of Bourgneuf&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We, mademoiselle?"
</p>

<p>
"My aunt, Madame de Bourgneuf, and
myself, to take shelter in the city of
St. Malo; but our carriage arrived at
St. Solidore too late last night, and Captain
de Boisguiller, commandant of the
redoubt at Cancalle&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that little redoubt cost us some
trouble."
</p>

<p>
"Gave us his own residence.  You
know what ensued.  Cannon shot fell
through the roof of the house, on which
my aunt, our servants, and I rushed forth
into the streets, and were separated by a
crowd of terrified fugitives.  Ignorant
alike whither to turn my steps, or where
to seek shelter, while shells were bursting,
flaming rockets and hand-grenades flying
about in every direction, I rushed into a
lonely alley, where I met a man who, by
his attire, seemed to be one of our Breton
peasantry&mdash;a woodcutter; but ah, <i>mon
Dieu!</i> he proved to be that wretch,
Theophile Hautois.  Politely enough he
offered to conduct me to a place of safety,
and led me from St. Solidore, away out
into the fields, where the country was
open and lonely.  There he spoke of love,
and attempted to kiss and caress me; but
I resisted, though sinking with terror,
and struck him in the face with my
clenched hand.  Then he grew enraged,
and tying my wrists, dragged me into that
mulberry grove, where heaven surely sent
you to my rescue."
</p>

<p>
"I am, indeed, most fortunate in having
been of such service to you, mademoiselle;
and I shall ever remember with pride that
I have seen and had the honour of speaking
with a daughter of the great Marshal
de Broglie, the hero of Sangerhausen."
</p>

<p>
She bowed and coloured with pleasure;
but when the sound of wheels was heard,
she clasped her hands and exclaimed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ah, mon Dieu</i>, how fortunate!  Now,
my kind friend, you shall be relieved of all
further trouble with me, for here comes
good and kind Father Celestine, le Curé of
St. Solidore."
</p>

<p>
While she spoke, a <i>désobligeant</i> (as those
small chaises which hold only one person
are not incorrectly named in France) was
driven rapidly along the road; but the
driver pulled up when my companion
called to him by name:
</p>

<p>
"Jacquot&mdash;Jacquot Tricot&mdash;where is
M. le Curé?"
</p>

<p>
"Here, mademoiselle.  Oh, <i>Clementissime
Jesu!</i> what has happened? how are
you here?&mdash;who is this man?&mdash;why in
such company? and who has dared&mdash;what
has he done to you? my dear child,
Jacqueline, what is the meaning of all
this?" cried an old gentleman, all in a
breath, as he opened the door of the
désobligeant and sprang agilely out.  As he
approached us, hat in hand, and bowing
low at every pace, I could see that he was
a fine looking old man&mdash;a priest, evidently,
as he wore a black silk soutan, with at
least fifty little buttons in front; he wore
also a tippet and small gold cross, and had
his white hair tied behind by a black
ribbon.  His pale countenance was mild
and pleasing, though he surveyed me with
an expression of eye which evinced that
he had no particular desire to cultivate
<i>my</i> acquaintance; and maitre Jacquot from
his box regarded me with undisguised
animosity and alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, dearest Père Celestine," said the
young lady, clasping his proffered hand
between both of hers, "I have been saved
from great peril by this kind soldier; but
take me away with you&mdash;oh, take me
away&mdash;and I shall tell you all about it."
</p>

<p>
"Kind&mdash;ha&mdash;hum.  <i>Monsieur le Soldat</i>,
I thank you," said the Curé, making a bow
so profound, that a cloud of hair-powder
flew about his head, and his little cocked
hat, which he was too polite to assume
before a lady, swept the road in his right
hand; "from my soul I thank you, for
Mademoiselle Jacqueline is my dearest
child."
</p>

<p>
"Have I the honour of addressing&mdash;&mdash;"
I began, for this phraseology bewildered me.
</p>

<p>
"Le Père Celestine," said Mademoiselle
de Broglie; "so I am now in perfect
safety, thanks to your kindness and
courage, monsieur; and now permit me
to offer you that reward which any soldier
may accept without reproach."
</p>

<p>
She drew a ring from her finger, and
placed it in my hand, saying, with a bright
coquettish smile&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"There is a language of precious stones,
as well as of beautiful flowers, and if
learned in such matters, you will know
what this gem is significant of."
</p>

<p>
The old clergyman waved his hat, and
laughed with great good humour, while
the graceful girl bowed to me again and
again as he handed her into the
dèsobligeant and shut the door.  The Curé
then placed his hat on his head, for the
first time during our interview, and with
true French gallantry sprang on the
narrow footboard behind his little carriage,
which was rapidly driven off, Jacquot
evincing, by his lavish use of the whip,
his desire to place as great a distance as
possible between himself and me.
</p>

<p>
The whole affair was like a dream.  I
placed the ring on my smallest finger, and
thought with delight of the lovely little
hand from which it had just been drawn.
I gave a lingering glance after the
fast-retreating <i>dèsobligeant</i>, which was bowling
along the road towards the ruined village
of St. Solidore, and then, springing into
my saddle, galloped in the direction of our
camp, the white tents of which were
shining in the rising sun, as they dotted
the southern slope of the hills of Paramé.
</p>

<p>
The stone was a fine emerald.
</p>

<p>
"Of what is it significant?" thought
I, remembering her words and her charming smile.
</p>

<p>
Charters, whom I met with three
mounted Greys, coming in search of me,
by order of the adjutant, told me that,
"according to an old superstition, the
emerald was supposed to ensure success in
love."
</p>

<p>
Be that as it may, this gift of Jacqueline
de Broglie has yet an important part to
play in the story of my adventures.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
